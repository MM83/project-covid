What was name of that girl from east london who was really popular?
I forgot her name anyway she was cool. It also like "the streets".
lily allen
Oh the media lied to me
I thought women want a ring on it and been done in the ass
all women
Yeah what a combo
I avoided all drugs and Aphex was intense as it was being just drunk
you knew Lily Allen as a kid?
She is single now, might give it a go
Maybe we should get him to the "Ruby God" documenary?
Maybe she could be your celebrity follower. Like Tom Crusie with Scientology.
Did you tell her that you are a god?
Yeah sounds like fun. I can say her "Alrigh' sweet cheeks!" Either love it or hate it
Sounds like a masterpiece
There is a gun shop next door to 70's rock n roll record store. In the gun store, looking at AK47 you could buy for 500 euros whilst "stairway to heaven" was playing.
Not sure if it was telling me; 
A.) Buy this gun & kill some things & will go to heaven
B.) This store is the stairway to heaven. 
C.) Buy this gun & stairway to heaven will unlock in this store
D.) love & Hate are so close & yet oppisote on the specium
E.) Just maybe its just random set of events
Oh ruby
I think it could make a good choice tree/scenario in a game
Just watching Oats Studio Volume 1 on Amazon - a series of short films from Neill Blomkamp - 1st short film about alien invasion which is actually scary
best alien invasion film I've seen in years
I recommend a watch
Rakka it is called
Ita a full film with a collection of short stories/films
they are very different in length, scope & style
some are like 1 min long whereas others are 25 mins long
I wonder if any of these short films will get funding for a full movies? I guessing that is what he is planning to do
Does that mean you eat Rubies?
that explains alot
Very cultured day for me
I dont know any darkness in both case scenarios
If you do one, I will do one.
Ruby?
Death metal
Will be that be the name of next novel?
I cant remember shouting let alone speaking in french
Right now its all very self indulgent. You should join in instead saying "I'm a designer I am not allow to do meta humour as I will judge as less of an creator"
Ruby & Lion have done one each so far. Be good to pop them in proper
Sing to us Mattius
Just finished reading "Animal Farm". Wow what a book, probably the best book I've even read
So genius
Me with Jeff what a combo
What torrents sites do guys use?
I've been out of the game for a while
OK But i mean the sites where you find the seeds for torrents to download (the content
i thought it closed down years ago
oh this is proxy bay
film/tv
thanks
obsession with american things?
is my dick american?
what?
are declaring vartibles again?
The problem I have with the internet & freedom of speech. People just like to moan & complain & use the internet to get acceptance & try to make everyone guilty & change the worldview to suit them.
Most of my younger days I was told I was stupid being dyslexic. These days, not so much as Im accepted it & figure out how to be happy with it. For now, become successful in my own right with that acceptance.
However on that note, most people know what dyslexic is & arent offended by it (some people get offended by my spelling). In this case; transexuals I cant figure out if they need to accept who they are themselves & to be happy in themselves rather use the internet or the problem is because people arent openly not accepting to transexual on the internet
Basically im saying why go on internet to get acceptance for who you are? I dont see Ruby writting tweets declaring the world that Ruby on wheels is only lanuage worth using because of its logic.
Lol
At least they have form of outlet or expression. There is no dyslexic bands or cool people. Richard Bradson is meant to be dyslexic but he is a twat.
Yeah It find it interesting that those people dont make it a "thing" or USP. Like Lion boy was saying maybe its a combo of age & thinking that people wont care.
Oh dear
Lets make Ruby, the 1st famious developer/developer reglion leader
oh ruby
You're been beaten to it!
Maybe you need to call "Ruby on stills"
How could they?
Greeks get donkeys
Any of you guys wanna this Mandy on Friday? 
Its quite early showing at 6.10pm
Dont get too excited
Alternatively there is a viewing at 11pm saturday at prince charles
Its very popular, most viewings are sold out
Oh really? How could you! I thought you were Mr I like pretty visual films arty type. At least, give them some money
Not enough lion action & roars
I guess movies are just about white people really, not very inclusive with other animals or people
Whatever! Tou codist, that only codes in Ruby
You codist
Out of seriousness, our pop culture isnt that diversity. Its getting better but still not great.
When you do seea  diverse film, it can intend to just tick the boxes for art charity/funding rather fit the story.
Yeah its pretty good
I saw in Athens actually
I'm not saying that film is but do get them
I remember watching a film about lesbian indian couple who lived above a fish & chip in Glasgow, WTF!
It was terriable
You guys should work in Hollywood
Oh ruby
It is my birthday on Sunday
what to meet your dad?
Can't imagine it. "Are you Ruby mastermind?"
when you coming back Sunday?
I be up for that. Ruby collage hangout
Its worth it for the dog alone
Cool
Ruby play den
I'm actually going to the Anchor pub with some co-workers if you want to join
Yeah
By the bar
You coming?
Cool
We are on a table under some stairs
Tell them your a god
Who was the person? Impressed?
Need to work on your pitch
"I'm a god for developers"
when you seeing krrupt FM again?
Its in Oxford right?
They not playing in London?
Fair enough
I see. The people who are you going you dont know too well? Yeah it can awkward; I guess over the years Im learnt how to break the ice.
Anyone around tonight for a drink?
I was going on a date but last min change of plans
I would but I think it would nicer & better if it was weekend planned being that you live far out!
Curry video?
Never played hitman
Thanks guys, oh wow the good old days
We should do a trip like that again in Thailand
Thanks Sam strong. Havent seen you in while, what been up to?
Yeah Indeedo. Where you based for work? Or meet around LB as you live near there?
Yeah still in LB
I do never miss the randomism at Blippar on the whiteboards
If we were to do halloween party dressed as Chris Jones, would you be dressed up as "Ham man"?
So would be just be typical Chris Jones or the halloween version of Chris Jones?
Just been watching Silicon Valley, it so close to bone. They nailed tech start up so well, its Blippar TV series
I recommend a watch, its very funny and spot on with whole tech world
Just dling now actually
Im up to season 3
Isn't he your favourite person in the whole world?
He looks old and abit of red
since I last seen him
Oh ruby
I missed half of the conversation in regards of the left/right politics split. I think the problem is that there isn't much diverse of parties or ideas. In the UK, we don't have mainstream hard left party. Whereas in south america you have some really interesting ideas/politcal & socialism systems but just hear of them because the media wants to talk "Britney spears getting her tits".
Thats my 5 cent anyway
Maybe we form our own party
Rubism
Rubycore
lol
Christianity returns
Anyone fancy a beer tonight?
Who are your mates? I have met them before
Oh ruby god
Oh Lion
Jonesy is the best character in Alien
Where did you get that book?
I do wonder if was a cat in previous life? Or a monkey?
Alien next door book too
I respect the donkey but doesn't mean that I was/nor never were a donkey.
I guess it depends if your personality remains the same between animals
I don't know the details how should animal Reincarnation works/ what people believe in
So I live forever?
I know they believe if you're good, you get reborn up the animal ladder. If you're good squirrel, you're next life you become a bear. If you're bad, you become a bee or something
I thought the reglion we were in process of intending as Rubism not Jonesyism
Mind fuck and a half
Jonesyism: Ruby in the Rough
Jonesyism: Ruby on the mind with your behind
Yeah its pretty good
Visually amazing
Quite funny in places
The set events in Mandy are great. Very bizzare and funny
I wasn't really sure what was going on half of the time although to be fair I was stoned which probably didn't help.
Anyone getting it?
We can form a posse
Jonesyism Massive
life at start up huh?
How is going your own start up? If you wanna chat, I know how stressful it is
BanyardYeah indeedo, when you free for that? Next weekend?
Oh wow cool!
So you may move there in Cali?
Isn't that part of the world very expensive? I guess you have to weight up if what they offer you up weights pros & cons living there.
Yeah I know that feeling
Yeah good luck, sounds awesome :)
You probably need to work for free at least 6 months; before you get paid as your company wont be ready to pay salaries
Its tough
Yeah that is why then I eat ham sandwiches
very affordable
& save alot of money
This in interesting review on RDR 2 - 
I always thought Rockstar design was behind the times with GTA 5 anyway
Zelda & Witcher 3 has raised the bar for sandbox game design
Variables
Are declaring them?
Your crimes you mean, you developed my logic?
Anyone fancy a drink tonight?
I realise its very last min
You still out?
At liverpool street, just read the messages
Ruby fake news
I've tried getting him to reglion conference like "godcon" but refuses to go. Written Rubyism values but refuses to promote it. I need someone he willing to sell & do some showmanship to spread the word.
Watch "Wild wild country" there is only so much PR person can do
I call "Ruby City"
With sign which says "Developers only"
"We are so inclusive"
Ruby ruby country
Not sure if its double postive or neagive
What?
Confirm your meaning?
Variable City - where anything can happen & be declared
(Belong it is logicial)
Sharks are cute & friendly
Massive attack are playing in Feb for £102 per ticket which is crazy money
Yeah sounds good
I didnt see this till now
You in town?
Work drinks are boring
Yeah thanks I dont think wanna pop your girl night
Her girl night
What day/time you both wanna go?
I get told that I look like Robert Web
I wish
Anyone out tonight?
What time you will be roughly be at mudlark?
Ok see ya in 20
Variables: the movie
Not too far from what Im actually listening to
No
WTF?
I dig it because its character study rather gangster/drugs film. Its not about politics, drugs & gangs. It's about single individual to raising to the top for all of wrong reasons who is so flawed but you love him for it.
Been chatting to Simon Chang (remember him?), anyone fancy a beer next Friday?
Its binary variable: Yes/No
Boolean output: Yes/No
UC 4 is good fun in MP & co-op
Yeah cant wait for the last of us 2
Naughty dog games are awesome
In what sense?
Set pieces in UN2 are best  scripted game scenes I've ever seen. Up there with COD 4 (when COD was good)
Especailly the train level
I've watched tech videos of how they made that level. Its so clever with its tricks & scripting
Still think UC2 is best one then 4
Spin off is very good too
Could do. Sounds like fun
Do a snooker night on Friday
I'm meeting Simon Chang
on Friday
I think we annonce that you're the Ruby god and created the logic of snooker
Say quotes like "I like mathematical process of figuring the perfect angles to get my balls in holes!"
You of course
Who is Simon Sinek?
Does he claim to some type of philospher?
Motivational in what? That's all young people are fuckers
I hear alot of people talk about this guy:
It meant to be crazy right wing guy who is super intellecual
True
Not into feminist?
Personally more of humanist
Which I guess feminist fits in with that
Fair enough
Alisa is hot
So wanted to bone that
lol
What is more humanist quote, I so want to bone this person
?
Bone her?
She is hot
Yeah did you hear from american chick again?
I thought you told her that "you are a ruby god!"
to earlier comment about Peterson, he is complete cunt with some brains which is why he getting alot of eyeballs
From the american girl? A slap?
Lol oh ruby
I thought Chinese people love chess or dominos
I saw lots of chinese playing chess in NYC in their parks
I did think it was cool, seeing public chess played
Just anyone can play
I was tempted to play but I'm crap at Chess
I was consisting my Vocal Trolling tactic by talking at them which usually works with Mario Kart
Being NYC I may get shot in the face or teabagged
Yeah exactly. Its more SEO friendly
Been thinking to Steph out as well? You remember him?
on Friday I mean
8pm
Will go there tonight if anyone is up for it?
Just got back from bleep/Athex twin pop up
Bizzare Athex twin mech
Not sure its worth going out your way unless you're hardcore fan. Its cool random store
Send what?
Ruby logic?
That was fun
We should do stuff like that more often
you have a good memory
What does any of that mean?
Ruby logic
Mandy sums up my life, always see shit like that
Anyone up drink tonight?
Last of my software testing course/exam
Yipeee i've passed the exam
It was intense
At least a professional QA
2bh it doesnt mean much; more about what Ive learned from it & excited to apply at work
As you know, knowing something and actually applying in the context of the problem are 2 different things
In the work.context
Yeah I feel good
Not big fan of directors of Blippar being apart of that group although I never use it tho
I hear v.good things about "Sorry to bother you"
Watching TimeCop & forgotten how bad it is
Timecop is no kickboxer
What a sign!
Only book worth reading
BlippAR = waste opportunity
Im a time traveller why waste time stating that one simple fact
All points boil down to that simple point
That is my ability although its as much as curse as a power
You see through crap & pin it down to simple points but it can depressing as I see shit before it happens
5 miles ahead of any one else
or more loney
Anyone want to go to this for NYE?
Ruby has declared this position on clubing
fireworks suck
and create air pollution
I personally don't get fireworks after 5 mins I'm bored
each to other own
each to their own sorry
With clubbing, inner stone man comes out!
Has anyone spoken with someone at Blippar?
Very sad news
Despire the jokes on RippAR, I did want them to succeed
I guess we can have RippAR reunion parties
Lol
Im trying to get Wagner job at my place as well so he will have plenty of offers
Sometimes fuck the hat
Oh Lion
Such lion like behaviour
I like it. Acceptence
You should embrace your inner lion more often
Nicely sadi keith
said
Slack is free
For small groups like us
Never hear of discord
Whats so special about Discord?
WhatsApp is the same FB messager in both fuctionality & the same of your data for their business model
Like you say that been for much longer. It doesnt fit FB's business model
Unless FB changes their model which might have to survive as FB isnt cool anymore with its 1000 lawsuits
Just depends if you care about your privary or not. Only thing that scares me alittle; we are quite outspoken on here about poltical matters. 
For an example; if Trump even becomes a facist dictator who kill anyone who speaks against hi . Technically he is nothing stopping him to scan our messages to find those who have. 
Just because this type of policial activities hasnt happened in 70 years in western world doesnt mean it wont happen again
I like to think digital era we live in is making a better world. This techology can be used as a weapon against us as much as helps us
I agree Ruby - well said
Oh ruby
I bet Garro loves that
do you have a photo of that random serect Santa you made for that BD woman at Blippar? You made out of plasticine
Oh wow
I wonder what she did with it?
Did she know it was from you?
Ho ho ho have an awesome Xmas! Ho ho ho
Yeah my mum is driving me nutty too. Keeps going on Brexit & how good will be
Oh samir oh dear! New year to you!
Happy new year everyone!
I was watching them from a flat on Vauxhall on their rooftop
Not usually a sucker for advertising. But this ad makes a fair point;
Lol awesome nonsense
I work down the road I join for a drink
Edgars GF? You mean his mum?
Story of my life that is. Getting bumfucked by random teenager via online gaming
I kinda see the simlarites between them
WTF?
Just such a bizzare series of events. Life of the RippAR just blows my mind
Tyler Thats the story of my life.
I have many stories of my life. It would be very boring otherwise.
Indeedo fables of life
Bro
Dalston has a KFC. The world is changing
Anyone up for this?
Its very min I know but seeing Leftfield wow!
So attempted to go to see Leftfield tonight altho Im getting old
Need to some substances to wake me up
Holly fuck balls

Ruby declaration
Oh shit dude didnt see your message till now. Could of stayed at my place
Oh fuck balls
Anyone fancy going to this?
Boolean: Yes or No?
A wise man once said voted for "Yes" in the poll.
April sometime
Not working on at the mon 2bh
why you ask Ruby god?
I thought you don't attend things as they come to you being a god & all
Oh ruby
I wanna go to Kubrick exhib, when you going? Could do a both date
Maybe they playing up to their audience who are usually geeks who dont get any. Whereas you are cool girl is who getting somw
cool geek who getting some
darn auto spell
Watch it with your GF she may enjoy the naked women. You been suprised
Who is going to stop Brexit party? Like to see 2 bears
Maybe that protest of the 21st century, its very different era from hippies in the 70's with love & flowers
I wish I was in that era seems like amazing time
Figuring by the movies if that is fair reference
Lusting after what? Sordy
I'm been told that "I am agent of chaos!"
Who the fuck is that guy?
WTF?
What is the world coming to?
If its real, I wanna be there
I might see with my sisters kids. Daniel is 9 & loves SW
Watches the force awakes like 3 times on a satursday
You might scary them with Ruby greatness
& give Daniel ideas
To become a ruby developer
RippAR is really dead now
He must be a actor
Just seems too extreme to be real
"Odd" isn't the word I use in this case, Odd is like someone who drinks a coffee with straw or eats their dessert and dinner at the same time. Not someone going completely ape shit over a Oyster card
So regarding Monday, what is the plan?
Would that be a good middle ground as a location?
I live in deep south, Frog lives south east, Ruby live south West & Lion is North
Or would somewhere more central be perferred?
What, why and how?
You're implementing your Ruby logic now right?
You sound like politician
Luke gets killed by a carrot
Disney will be unstoppable now with them buying up 20th century fox
Going to see aliens fight marvel characters soon
I was reading how disney will have 30% of the hollywood market share
Which is crazy
I read that as "Aladdin with face fuckers"
That is abit of trueism
Who doesn't
Cock one probably wouldn't perform would it?
That's from my experience
For entertainment it is exciting but for society as a whole as it is scary. Disney, Apple, Google & Amazon will control the world hahahahaha
Depressing but a good informal read
WTF! That Blippra video is awful
Although it is nice idea
new verison of blippar or complete new app?
Ruby Samir oh dear Chris high adventures
Is "The Foreigner" any good?
Interesting that they are parnering up Sigur RÃ³s, you can't get much more emo or Hipster than that band
They know their audience
They are very good live, I remember seeing last year with Samir at a festival.
Samir had his pill face
Face feels sore from the rape
Looks like a cum face
I didnt realise Croydon has hosepipes.
Thanks mate wishing me death by hosepipe
Annoyingly myself & Shaun will not be moving in our flat till 30th (Saturday) so we may not have the time to prepare for a house party
Any other NYE plans so far?
Ruby god has spoken
Yeah I really enjoyed it
But then again I compare it against typical hollywood films like fast series, transformers, etc
My expectations were low
Isnt a good thing? Something different & unexpectated?
There wasnt much of a cliffhanger for sure. I actually liked that they are trying break up the forulma little
I got a feeling that they will plug in episode into the new trilogy (unrelated trilogy)
Episide 9 I mean
With vegans & Rudy developers
Going to central, anyone fancy a beer in town later? I need to get out having some serious cabin fever
Sam strong or Sam Hobbit?
You heading to Shoreditch?

Invite them along. Be good to see you tonight
WTF
Lovely bum.tho
Jusy chatted Ruby development they loved that shit
Just got up
Everyone had a good time last night?
He has a fair point
Croydon is the land of stab. No one talks or cares about that
I remember reading that there to be used 2/3 stabbing per day in Croydon. That was like 10 years ago
Been watching Jean-Claude Van Johnson
Its very funny
He clearly doesn't take his self too seriously and its very entertaining
Isn't he like Gay icon as well?
Variables
Yeah it was very good
For me; its throw between the arcangel episode, or spaceship episode as the best.
Dating app episide was very good too
This is piece of art. The best song ever written & performed
Pedro game looks pretty awesome. I wonder how they vary up the gameplay?
Yeah maybe they introduce bullet dodging enemies that can slow down time too
Is this picture from the internet or or you take it?
Did he see you?
I think we need to create our own religion
Rubyish
Should be about my followers as you guys always take photos of me.
Call it 8 photos from Chris Jones
People want to take photos of the people who actually taken a real photo of the "Chris Jones"
Make a cult vital app where anyone could become a cult victum of photography
So you just see Jesus instead
Yeah I get that alot
Made out with a girl that said only wanted a kiss cause looked like him, bitch
time invested in a idea
interesting fact
What about rubies?
Do they bend in space?
You sound like you're in Ruby Heaven
Its been my list for years
Never had the space or money for 6 epic fuck off books
Boring message; anyone work place looking for digital PM contractor or QA contractor at the moment?
Cool, is that approved up coming job?
WA?
Samir oh dear
Why of what? Sorry. QA for me & PM for someone else
Yes please, any work is good right now
Thanks
Charm endearment
Tommy Wiseau is my hero
Will there be any cyber vegans there?
what do you need get for subscription to Pornhub? More porn? I thought its all free anyway
Depends on the your definition of Veganism is & classlation of humans. As technically oral sex isn't vegan as you're eating an animal part
What?
They put a car in space?
Next gen
I think it could change your life
Random questions: Does anyone here you know of any good 3D artists who give a good assets away for free?
Working with these students who are making games but they are crap at art
Its not for me, its for University I'm lecturing at
Do students even have any money?
Well I didn't anyway
I remember I used to try to figure out the cheapest most filling meals
Our combo was rice and beans which to last for weeks
40p and you make a dish for a week
Varliables
What is a POKE command?
That is ilogical answer & not related to set subject at hand
Wow the god has spoken
Yeah it does look like alot of fun
Rape?
Zoom rape?
Sorry wrong group
How did you get that?
Did Radu share it with everyone?
I think its funny that Danny has said "No"
Radu is so bizarrely self entitled, its werid
I also broken my neck like 5 times today because melted snow
I'm stuck in Petts Wood, I can't leave. What is the train situation like for you guys today?
You back in the UK Lion boy?
or Lion man
Oh come guys, dont bash gay guy. Its must be hard to fully admit your gayness with you Alphas
Awesome :) Do they have any signature moves? Harris only moves
You should make Blippar Wrestling series. Ruby God vs Sam Strong. Code related moves
Anyone up for a cheap holiday in Majorca, Spain from 2nd to 9th of April?
£100 return flight & £200 hotel
Yeah I would like to go again, its very awesome Japan
Yeah we plan another gang holiday or do a festivial which msy be easier to oragise
End of the road festivial sounds good - 
Does he ever get roadrunner?
Its funny how simple it is. You never get away with that anymore, people want orgin story for everything & why they hate each other
Yeah I remember they sucked
Also they had huge budgets for voice actors & solid animation. Producers clearly missed the magic there
I guess they wanted to moderism it but failed
Oh ruby god
Real shame
No doubt someone will do that with tech we have these days
Could you get front photo of the new guy? I think may be ex-flat mate mine many moons ago
So you not going to provide me a picture of his face? You used to rape my face all the time, so I dont see this being any different
Photogenic isnt the factor to consider. A face is a face
Oh Lion boy! You hitting on me?
I so wanna play this game
I'm attempted to buy Xbone just for this game
You should love it has very well defined logic and variables
You getting it?
Step zero?
Oh ruby god
My bum feels sore now
Too much face rape
Indeedo
Couple days for what?
That is beyond my logical or functionality output. Maybe as a god, you can do that
Ruby gosling
Awesome use of AR kit
I personally really enjoy stranger things
its very self aware of what it is
You should love war games, its all about logic
Logically decisions on nuclear war
you like this video
Seems like your logic
Does anyone want him working there anymore?
Probably just wanting to get fired for a a big cheque
Oh dude what is wrong with you?
Any one up for a beer tonight?
Just myself right now
Fancy popping up to Old Street?
Or should I come to London Bridge?
Wework at Old Street has free beer
41 Corsham St, London, N1 6DR
But I can meet you somewhere else
Where are you Ruby god?
Same
The mud fart?
Anywhere but not the mud fart
Oh fuck
You there now?
OK I will make a move
I think the future is choice driven content. At certain scenes, you choose the outcome and after watching your version in the cinema, its good social discussion on what happened in your version
I wonder if netflix & cinema could do something like that
You choice the outcome on your phone
The content could have various levels of quality
I think the challenge is the choice in context or the choices provided to the user. Walking dead the game (TellTale games) did the user choice story well, as the overall story structure remained the same but choose the detail rather creating the main event. For an example, you are in a house & the house gets attacked by zombies (this will always happen) but two people are attacked, you can only save one person. That choice affects your relationship with the group of people you are with. "Why didnt save you Ruby, he could of used his logic to turn zombies to back to human"
Rather changing the series of events, it changed your relationship with the people you were with & how they interacted with you
"Why did you save Lion? He roars all of the time attracting more Zombies"
What am i looking at?
Som stars?
some stars
Awesome, look forward to hanging out with you
Anyone seen Pacific Rim 2? Wouldn't mind seeing although I looks crappy
Did you end going to Isle of dogs exhibition in the end?
After watching it, did you end wanting a dog although you're a cat?
Did he resign or get let go?
I remember Samir convinced one of the french that I was ex-director from Pixar
He was asking why I left & I just said "Blippar is so much progressive and creative than Pixar"
Radu probably just wanted the leave money anyway
on hindsight, I wished I played that card myself
I wonder how far he will get with this BS?
You be surprised how far it can get you if you know what you say
I deal with fuckers like this every day, its sometimes hard to see through what is true & BS
Yeah I find him difficult too but I liked him as he seemed care about the blipps (pride for his work) whereas most blipp devs couldn't give a shit. This was back in 2014 so probably very different now
He is on the spectrum for sure, not sure if he was aspergers
I worked him back in 2014 before the real power games began (for my experience anyway)
Simon Chang had to work with him post this period but then I was stuck with Phil
Not sure who is worse
Thinking about, Blippar was filled with Power hungry dicks in senior positions
Billy Mitchell is showman & has personality for game competitions. Most of best players just arent that entertaining so I can see why Twin Galaxies loves Billy
Every interview from Billy is just great. Mostly for the wrong reasons
Are you coming back to London? I think I remember seeing a message you saying this or maybe I was dreaming.
oh dear Be great to see ya. We should plan holiday some time/somewhere. Do you think we should all go to bangkok?
Are you saying you need to be wanker to wear these shoes or just a wanker for wearing shoes altogether?
With your iconal Trump who knows
Oh Ruby
I look forward for you to become Ruby Wan
Wild wild country is really good doc
Highly recommed
Its a great story with alot of layers & unanswered questions which I really like about it, its a very factual doc. It doesnt force a opinion on either side
Liked how it wasnt clear who the puppet master/master so to speak.
Remember watching on doc netflix about esports - teams of legue of legends
Its insane
Which was pretty interesting
Its very good doc isnt it? I attempted to go to India to try it out
Sounds like bizzare set of actions. I wonder if they still have lots of sex or if that is 70's thing?
You should watch wild wild country
What varables you are declaring there Sam?
What is weather like in the UK right  now? I hear there is some heat wave or something
Yeah they are good
Oh fuck, I better get mentally prepared for the cold weather
Its symbol & status of rubies on the earrings, not the function
Yeah cows weren't too interested. Just like human  femalea
females
Never played them :( I played front mission & Steel Battalion, armoured core back when
Yeah although it took up some much space
Front Mission were hardcore turn based strategy games
I played the playstation 1 one whichever one that was
I was going to go but headed home instead
If I knew you were going, O would of came
I was going with Shaun & he pulled out last min
Nah sorry Im on the train back to home land
Its far, Petts Wood. Im so looking forward to move back in the flat
Were declaring variables at him like you do with me sometimes?
Ruby is simpifing the message with his logic
Actually that sums up my problem
Nah Ruby, animals would alot to say
Crocs, whales, dolpins too
Oldest animals on earth
They are animals I would speak with
Human Civilisation stuff beyond 5000 years is really interesting as we know so little about it officially anyway
IIIuminati are one of the oldest clubs which knows all this stuff
Theories that they hide & change key historical events from getting out to still control
As they control capitalism, they are 0.1%
Yeah never the less, it is interesting where we come from and our history
as a species
Its amazing time to be living. We are apart of the 1st digital revolution pre-Matrix
We are seeing the development of the 1st digital religion based on code & logic with Ruby God.
No emotions, only logic
when I was born, there was 4,759,902,658 other people on earth
Its double since right? The world's population
Like start a coding reglion?
Animals do respond very well to "Hi. I'm Chris" you know? Like (Whatever her name) Mike Harris ex GF's dog
Maybe you should make rubysweeper?
That is very Microsoft thing to do. I hope one day they have same impact & greatness they had, these days they seem a mess. Nothing works & disconnected from everything
Hopefully lens may put them on the map again although I feel it will be corprate only product
MS know their market
its super fitting for me as my name is Jonesy
I really like the T-shirts
oh Ruby
diseases have no MERCY
Just met up with Wagner for lunch which was quite nice
Oh Lion
Weekes How was the event last night? Interesting?
Bummer I should of went :(
Anyone fancy a beer tonight in London Bridge?
No worries
Samir oh dear
When you coming over?
Only 4 days, dude! I need to get some serious Samir love in such short amount of time
Yeah that's a rubyman plan. He is building effective developer religion now
You have followers
Well done Radu for a career change & the job
Im amazed he got a job in that role but looks like the company that doesnt much expertise in that field or its much proirty for them
Really?
Probably drinks at my new workplace
but could meet later in London Bridge
Talk about fish & chips again
Oh Sam I havent seen in ages
I liked the last Jedi at least changed the story forulma/structure but it was marvel messy
It covered alot of things without much depth but that is hollywood
At least you never bored
I accept that is 10's  hollywood style. Like with 80's style movies, you dont moan where the good strong guy gets his minigun from, just enjoy bullet action & one liners.
They should do Akira anime TV series
at that quality :P
Oxenfree is great.
Good stoner game
Never hear of that one. Sounds like midget porn
This song is piece of art
Why do drugs? Just listen to this song
I've been meaning to play "her story" but never get around to it. Same for "papers please"
Just end up playing something easy like Uncharted although amazing in a Hollywood type of way
Easy as easy to play, don't need to think too much
the sequel to papers please?
Papers forever
Papers I hate
He looks very rapey
Oh fuck I just saw the little girl in the background bend over. Thats even worse.
Rape central
Anyone up for a quick beer in the sun? Weekes
Coming now
Usually everyone else gets sex and I don't so that sums it up quite well actually
If I had a band I would call it "Chris Jones and the Vegans"
Or JoneZ
JoneZ McBone
What does HOGG stand for again?
Anyone up for going to Boom Town festival?
you want to do something other than drinking? You feeling OK?
I up for it BTW
That is quite funny. Never been to glasgow, is it a shithole?
He is probably 1/8 american
where you going to?
Im moving back Hackney in 6 days
Sorry I rephase where are you moving to?
Oh ruby god
Pripyat is hardcore trip. Probably need to buy hazord suit & AK47
to enter
I remember I used go drinking in Acton, its full of Austrilans. We used to go a bar called "Red Neck" you would walk out with at least 3 STDs
"Good day, I need a cock" with their legs open. It was very classy
you're right. Thats what we used to call it as it was red neck. I think it was called "The red back"
Yeah you will love it
Would of loved it
Oh wow. So is everyone in MV office fired or relocated to London?
I like Kiwis personally. I like how they say "pear" & "yes"
Aussies are hit or miss, extremely annoying or just lovely
Im suprised it has taken this long
Then again I would of thought their image recogision APIs is only product that makes them money
Yeah human history is really interesting
Especially when you think we are like 5th/6th Civilisation.
I'm no expert but you have Egypt civilisation, Mesopotamia (apparently created the concept agriculture, working together to make food rather just cavemen hunting on own), Ancient China, Aztec, etc
People keep finding old cities but have reference to how/why they exist
Nah Ruby is god, not a civilisation builder.
I find it really interesting. Probably why I enjoy travelling
seeing different cultures & history
Yeah of course that is crotean pop culture mate :P
Yeah that is Thai culture
lol
If I was going to call this civilisation something "Western Capitalism" I guess. If you think about Europe has we know has only been around for 600 years which in history isn't that long really
The idea of our Civilisation dying out Bioshock style isn't going to happen on this planet with global ecomany and the digital output
I wonder how it could die? Maybe we just run out of trees
what come from?
Yeah lol
Or everyone lives on Mars & forgets about Earth
If you were born on Mars, you're not going to care about Earth
Isn't that the place where they all wears beret and kiss everyone on their cheeks even if they like them?
Throw cheese at each other in wine rage
Another start up idea I just had; Jones fucked up holidays
Just take people on tour & hire actors to fuck it up to act up on cultural sterotype
yeah lol
lol oh dear
The thing is some people may take the humour as fact
Its not like internet doesn't dislead people enough with real facts
Yeas, yes & yes
America would be easy. Just a gun trigger american (with a fake gun) to start waving his gun about, stating that they bored shooting schools & want to shoot a tour bus instead
I probably use word "treacle"
Just get business man to start taking photos & say "awwww white people"
"Do you have cheese with sushi?" with a huge bow
"Do you do business with honor & pride?"
"You lack discipline, I not finished"
"You catman, need DFS - Discipline, Focus & Structure"
I still on Japan
Yeah that could work
I would either have to skinny or fat bear to display the state of capitalism.
You actually sound quite serious. Like speaking with a investor
He might enjoy the irony of ot
it
How do you do bold on here
Irony that I probably or the actor is getting it wrong
Enjoys our preception of his culture
*Sexy*
_Sexy too_
So you're not investing?
lol
On more boring note, from the ex-Blippar crew do was good BD?
Game Design Consultancy needs a good sales/DB person
Was he good?
Oh yeah Happy Bday frog girl
Where did you go tonight? The Frogs arms?
The Ruby God
Where you order drinks by declaring Ruby functions
Nah sorry mate
Is it your fave cartoon when you were a young-un?
WTF
I remember a lame kids live action show called "The queen's nose" where you make wish with this special coin by rubbing the queen's nose
Which sounds simlair
The whole show was basically wishing for something that ends up wrong somehow
You got glasses?
Are they Ruby coloured?
Of course they do. Glasses are very fashion these days
Alot of people that make big impact are called "Ruby"
Like Ruby Wax
What did Blippar do to piss off this Jouro so much?
What tech company isn't fill of shit?
Yeah look at FB, apple & Google. Journos are out for them
pitchfork time
Don't use my name
I don't want to near this shit storm
Anyone fancy a pint in London Bridge?
English?
Ruby logic
Say via IM or in person? For a developer, I know these are different things
128
That is useless
512 is better number
8 squared
Or cubed?
Fits 8 bit
Each number is a dimersion
8 x 8 x 8 = 512
That is 8 cuded?
Cubed
Why is that?
Oh shit
2 pengoned?
2 octogoned?
So 8 bit machine store 24 values
You said each v
bit stores 3 values; 0, 1  2. If you have 8 bits. That is 8 x 3 = 24
Oh I see.
Major skoolage here, im learning something
Who is he?
Oh yes remember you guys saying that he hates Blippar
Lol
I think all ad agencies were blown away by Blippar which why they had so much clients
The range of clients Blippar had was impressive
You got sales down
They got sales down
Oh ruby
Yeah same, can you guys still comment?
This is fun
Randoms are loving it
I think Star Wars is trying to appeal to too many people. Is it for old fans or creating new fans? I think more the latter but its abit confused. I personally quite enjoyed last jedi for what it was.
You talking to me?
"Donkey Rider - He pissed by the way people treat the donkeys"
Don't talk to donkeys that way, mule fucker
You're only as donkey as you feel.
I need to watch Taxi driver again I haven't seen it in years
since my 20s
Remember it being an awesome film
Im moving house tonight
Exciting & stressful
Unless you wanna help me move
Its very sexy
Indeedo god lord
Living with 3 kids is too much
Copyright
Why did they have that? Fuckers were always partying in their pool
Some rich MV fucker
Double whammy
Glad it be back in Hackney for such a discovery
The most exciting thing in Petts Wood was the weatherspoons
I wonder what is vegan doner?
Just a wrap
That splash screen cost them a tiny fountune
Davey
Oh Lion

WTF? Birmingham I guess
You're toilet stinker at Blippar I knew it
They smell very Ruby like
Lol next gen shitage
Maybe that is how the future will shit
?
Wow it created a link from that
FB is getting paid by CNET
Anyone up for beer tonight?
I won't finish work till 7ish tho
Working on taking over the world with Ruby on Wires like Facebook? Developer Network connecting code with blockchain
I hope
but probably not
Thats where he lives right?
Ruby you went to his house didnt you?
Game gear was so pointless for that reason & they were huge
Lol I've always preferred Mario 2bh. I like 1st few Sonic games & sonic spinball back in the day but after that, im meh
Just thinking if there even been a bad mario game
Sonic has lot of shit games
I hear good things for Sonic Mania
I used to love Offspring
Live they were really fun
I think they are still going
We should go & do the crystal maze
We should go as a team. Call it The Ruby Lions
What does maze master do? Just tell people the rules of the game
Wow that is next gen
Go to festival for the summer I thinks
Same! I can't arsed anymore as the sites keep closing down
Content appears on other platforms so quickly these days
paid services have enough content I want so why bother pirating
?
I remember platform channels like PSN or Netflix were bollocks 5/6 years
£5 per month - what beer you bought?
Must have been donkey piss
Sorry its been a long day
Sorting out variables
you mean 8 million beans
Get your declaration right!
Its all about "Ruby"
Its very awkward dry humour
I like it
I just assumed it was made up mysterious marketing friendly name that sounds cool.
If we were going to make a film on Ruby you would call "Lord of the Rubies" or "Ruby talker"
Rather Nick Stone: The Movie
People might think its movie about my sponsored donkey
1st time I hear you say something was "Awesome"
Usually its "That's not illogical" or "My varliables are better" or "I dont know Ruby it sucks"
The god with many words
I haven't seen Solo yet
Anyone who hasn't seen it yet?
Looks like clash royale in terms of the mechanics
Isnt it based on old RPG card game from the 90's?
Excited by the new Doom gamw
game
a weeks ago I remember going to an area called "Ham"
Near Richmond
I wonder what the story be like for cyberpunk 2077? With Witcher, its based on a book but be interesting what will be like. The universe looks very cool
Inspired heavily tho from what I hear
If you have IP already, certainly makes easier to focus on other areas
of game production/development
In theory
Anyone watching the Ubi-soft conference?
For what purpose?
To grow ten dicks
No thanks
You are a god so I take your word for it
Your dick produces a ghost to scare people away?
New assiassin's creed looks boring
I see, that gives it some context! Witcher 3 was awesome, I still haven't played the DLC yet
Attempted to play it again from the begining
BlippAR stuff never made sense
Just buzzword fluff
Im so confused by this thread. WTF
Cats & space. What a combo
Yes the cat
You're a Lion. You should know your cats
It worked
Can't blame me for trying
They wouldn't sell me a ticket so I'm going to get in if they like it or not
Damo is out of agency work?
Not sure if I go to pub, people here do intend to get violence if things don't go their way
I find football boring to watch 2bh
I'm weird cause I find enjoy playing it for real in a field. I'm shit but its really fun kicking a ball around
I mean English football fans in general, people just lose their shit after a game of 22 men running about field for 90 mins. It's not life or death, its a game.
In other words, people take it way too seriously
There is nothing wrong with passion or excitement for a game. I love Mario games. But its not my life, if someone said "Mario was crap", I'm going to stab them and start yelling "Mario is the best"
*I'm not going to Stab them I mean
I hate FB messages that you can't edit messages
FB messager
They are pretty good band
I think they are vegans
This is a random question, does anyone know get rid of ants? I have ants nest in my yard somewhere and they keep coming into my flat.
You taking the piss?
I hear white vinegar & lemon peal works too?
measuring 10 parts of water & sugar is hard to get measurements right?
Just open some windows
Too many mate, their army of ants
Still to determined, they are having an ant town meeting
Yeah vinger & lemons worked so far
No sugar to me, only for the ladies
You seen "The army of darkness"? "Give me some sugar baby!"
Worked like treat on my last GF
Tried that but i cant find the nest
Likes a needle in a haystack
Yeah indeedo just throwing hot water around outside
Just tell the police that my Ruby god told me to do it
Oh Ruby
Origins stories for the ruby god
Ruby tech metology
Just went to see "hereditary". Best horror film I've seen in ages. Highly recommend
Im avoiding the riots
I agree with him. Brexit is fake news nonsense of false pretense that I know something or should. No one knows what it is, what it means. But everyone pretends that are a expert with informed opinion.
Just annoying
you are a god. So you define your own logic and rules around you.
Hours of fub giggling at your meat
Fun
Anyone fancy a drink tonight?
Good for her. I guess TFL do rip you ofg
Off
Anyone fancy hanging in Town tomorrow?
Central perhaps
Amazing! The best book I've even read
The god has spoken
Yeah born in 1983. I feel old saying that; should be all wise & stuff
Quited honoured to named after some wind
You named after a programing lanauage, you should be honoured too.
Not many people can say "Im Java man" or "Im C++ person"
All of work mates are bummed, Im like "I dont give a fuck!"
To be fair england has come along way since I last see them play
From what book? The Ruby bible?
Jonesyism I prefer :P
Just Stoicism. Interesting Philosopy
Maybe Rubism could based on this with focus on positive thinking for code
Lol
Oh ruby
Oh Ruby
Oh wow who is america looks great :) The old american guy has to be actor, can't be for reals
Wow that is pretty next gen. He did all that himself? Looks CGI company quality production values.
he is like you. He must some type of CGI god
Pretty much everything in modern world is superfluous. We dont need much to survive or to live a meanful life yet we choose  to surround ourselves with 
pointless objects all round us which in the big picture of things add very little value. So maybe the word "Ruby" as your title is pointless but actually useful to used as communication device to inform people of type of powers you have.
Frog girl beaten you to it with "Jones" clothes although I like those green jeans
I have to say I like those green jeans
Green ones? You have to be specific when talking in this thread filled with devs :P
Too on the nose?
Finally No man's sky is the game that should of been when it came out
and looks playable
Whatever you space jerk
lol
Yeah because its looks like actual game rather just tech demo with no game
As piece of technical engineering, its amazing but you can tell they released too early. Hello Games was still figuring out what game is and Sony forced to get it out for fuck you to Microsoft which worked.
That is where Scott vs the world is set
Been to Vancouver when I was younger, it was very nice :)
Yeah lol such a great movie
Been wanting to read graphic novels but never got around to it
I think I would be very bored of life after a billion years
What is Andromeda? Skool me
We should try to make these type of macarons
When, where & how?
For the cooking macarons sessions
On a different topic; I've been wanting to make some electro music? What is good newbie instrument/synthesizer to jam?
Like this?
After buying that, you just need some speakers
From looking at this video; it looks like good combo is Kaos pad 2 with a circuit - 
Is that a good combo?
Awesome, very useful, Thanks guys
Always to get a Tenori-on
pretty pricey too: 
Sounds good
Going for phone interview for product madness for gambling game company, just looking at their products. Usually I have something to good to say but in this case; I'm stuck for words
Product Madness
Gambling games
Yeah indeed
No bad reviews?
When at peace, always prepare for war
In other words, never get comfortable especially at start up.
QA are always the first to go
Just saying, its always to have options
always good
always good to have other options
I'm giving your funds in a virtual currentcy of Ruby bucks, takes a while to mine it
I know what you're saying; I'm very logic about this stuff. I haven't passed probation yet and  I don't know what they are thinking nor happening behind the curtains/politics. Better to safe than sorry
No its a start up mate
Coding in your Ruby palace! Nice land
Wow we should do it
Go in August
I can go to do some donkey whispering
How come?
The logic isn't ruby?
I see, when is the project up?
You start your own cult
you should start your own cult
lol
Its not up to management. They get company to vote which is weird I know
Its also abit big brother
The app called "Totem" which is an employer engagement app basically facebook with gamification. There is feature called "Polls" they use that to get everyone feedback on the person for their  & whatever they think they should stay or go.
Yeah same
Its a bit cult and weird 2bh
culty
Why you say that?
Yeah indeed
Also conflict can very positive
you're fighting for what you think is right for the product
Leon may want lions in it whereas UX guy wants eels in the game
Especially with my role, I naturally upset people giving them bugs
A lot of the job is knowing what stuff to raise to avoid too much conflict
its a fine balance
I'm sure people like me but as you all know i'm not exactly very normal. Some people just don't get that
Especially typical product managers
Anyway enough moaning
Sorry boring huh?
I see what you mean
If I was you, just take some time and make your own stuff - Rubycon
Yourself or the company you work for?
Who is we?
I'n not asking what thing is, I'm asking is what thing made by just yourself or at work?
Oh Ruby
So it's a work thing not personal project? Sorry another question
Are getting promoted to become the pope of Rubism?
I guess, I haven't the created org structure yet
So you wanna go Croatia again in August?
It seems that things are very much up in the air for you right now
The cottage looks lovely for sure
Like eyes? As looking into eyes or just nosey?
They like looking into your eyes? Do they wink at you?
Why are people into food always fat?
In robot voice" I can't tell, there is no declared variables to define the intention for this human interaction"
No
No it was more just general observation which wasn't expecting any response
Maybe if when the game, music, book writing ambitions are done/gone
In other words, there Is other creative projects I want to do 1st
Yup
Nah just ideas right now
2bh
less talk, more do is my problem
Its other way around currently, more talk, less do
What is he doing?
Where are you?
Dj club?
Back to topic; the solution less work & stress, more free time to do it. Hopefully my job/career progresses I get paid to think rather just having deliver (do) work smart basically. That was problem I had with Blippar, no one wanted to work smart.
Yeah exactly but with good results
Lol
You are Agile
Im going to see some live wrestling tonight if anyone wants to come? I just remembered
Its only tenner
Yeah that one in Camden Sold out
I'm pretty casual, I don't know any of wrestlers or anything. Just want see some wrestling
You take part in the wrestling, become "Ruby man"
Punch people in the face with your catch phase "Variable"
If you win, you say "You lack logic of the real moves of wrestling"
where did you buy your ticket? I looked a few weeks ago & Cameda one was all sold out, so I bought tonight event instead
See if I enjoy tonight's show
Oh ruby
That is your idol
I will roar at them
People (work people) enjoy a good roar
Why do jew people have huge fuck off noses?
nah internet cut out
I was write the caption "what is jungle jeep doing in London?"
Not a jungle size in London village mate
WTF was I talking about?
Can you remember? You are god which may have database of each communication interaction received
Is Sam still alive?
Hassen I mean
What did he do for FBI to invate?
girl your hero's tootgbrush
Toothbrush
Just discovered this:
Clearly femanism made this game
Probably one of your fans made this using your Ruby framework
Hell of a use case for your tech
Lol
Sadly I dont think BJ exists anymore but the Ruby remains
Chill on the attack, sweetcheeks!
Dude dont troll a start up. BF is in shitty as enough as it is.
The app is what we make at my company. I like to think there to way to solve problem but yeah I get what you're using
Saying
Yeah I just work there
Yeah we make it, but the feature is poll so the company can use for it any  use case they want
So company could use it to ask "How was your week?" For an example. As employee, you pick a selection.
My company use for getting feedback on new employees
Yeah I agree
Some things are really like there & other things not so much. I guess it is always like that, you have mix the good with the bad
Its actually not too bad game
Do you think he will like cunt wars?
There is so many things wrong & right about it
Just whole concept & presentation of it, its amazing that they get away with sheer ballness of it
No wonder you were in a mood
He is just a typical dictator. Pablo Escobar did the same thing
The public suffered because didn't want to give in
Can't you make one using Rubicon engine?
The god has spoken
lets do that
Are they in English?
Oh OK I thought your still Crotea
We should play the board games, do a board games day
How was visiting your roots?
Are into the way of the ruby as much as you?
I'm getting old for drugs I'm afraid
I probably forget how to go to toilet
Were they honoured?
Did they drink Vodka to your victory & shoot their AK47s?
Yes
Wetting isnt too bad, its when shit yourself. The smell stays around for days.
I thought you value a fast & effective end result rather the thought process required to come the result
So I just speed it up
I love these conversations
Logic battles
If this was rap logic battle; would it be "Be precise by the book Ruby" VS "Define my own rules Jonesy"?
Just say my inlogically friend is always fighting my logic
If he asks "what logic?", the logic of Rubicon which we want to re-create the matrix
Let me guess he is business person. Too busy being in, rather thinking about "ON" it
2bh that is strength as well as weakness, I think way too much which in fact really meanless
Does it have to make sense? You're entertained/amused right?
Wasnt Maximus a dictator?
Another Ceasar?
I think that would be a very different experience
Watching that scene as if it was a film
Sorry I misread your post
I would you meant querying as debugging the code for the crowd's logic
It would be time traveller hacker movie, going back to different time periods to hack people
Nick & Chris, logic changers
You have you all seen Kury fury? Surf & hack through time
I think you could tutorials how to use Ruby on Deals (whatever it us called now)
Ruby on frills
Anyone around for a beer?
Later
Yeah plus its hot. I may be getting drinks from work crew
As its end of probabion today
The vote is happening
I've passed.
That is a reflict
OK up for a beer?
What about the anchor?
Drink by the river
you joining?
Weekes You still at RippAR office?
Stone You coming?
I'm on my way, see ya in 5 mins
Im at Anchor now
Walk god
Be good for you
Plus there is a water which is resource that has created all forms of life on earth
Where are you? now
I so wanna visit - 
A shite may add to the deco
Has anyone here been to Russia or Moscow? I'm thinking I might go in October
Buy a AK47 and become truly Russian
i just pretend to be Irish
techically I've half Irish
from my mum's side
Keep moaning at me to get a Irish passport, although I'm beginning to see her point
You're Russian aren't you? Recommend Moscow?
That worked, I received an answer
1st world problem, can't decided where to go. Might to Warsaw, never been to Poland
Lol anything else? Good nightlife?
Things to do?
I hear the Volka is good there
Oh ruby
jusy get traps
no clubs
I like my own farts?
WTF Ruby
Are you polish as well?
Animal action
The god has declared his feelings on american TV content
The god has started sending pictures of his followers to encourage inspiration and further interaction
Progress bar 50% completed for task: fan encouragment which taken 4 years to this point
He was 1st QA on Blipp Builder?
Banker twat
I cant remember him calling church ears but its something I would come up with
I wonder why? Maybe he used to talk about a god alot
Christian god
I cant believe that was 4 years ago
Does time fly?
I cant remember Ive been in my flat for 3 years now
RippAR was pretty crazy reflecting on it, just volume of people that went through it.
Great social channel to meet people
My company now is growing but its like one new person per 6 weeks
Old days Blippar it was 6 new people per week
Yeah Layar culturally was wrong but also what I thought was weird that they were really entitled & had a lot of weight (power) when Blippar bought them. No one put them in their place and ultimately in the long term, killed them as they just didn't want to play ball.
Myself included and everyone who worked with them just said "they were difficult, liked talking but not do much" which isn't Blippar way I'm afraid
2014/2015 were good Blippar years
I went down hill asap as they moved in LB, although a lot better office than Holborn
yeah indeedo
Also it was just different stages/levels of maturity
The god has stated a fact
Kneel before ruby
Imagine Ruby as superman Villain in the 70's
Would he be gaying up the world?
Superman is making sure everyone stays straight
I don't think I could exist within superman universe
I think could exist in the batman universe
I think I'm defo Joker
maybe the riddelr
The logicer - finding logic when there is none
How Ruby
That is something from a god
You guys coming out tonight?
I rather develop logic on my pants than interact with mindless human beings #getoutthehouseyourubydev
I speaking as if I'm you
Speed & efficiency
*Robot voice (If it isn't obvious)* Speed & efficiency is most important to the achieve the goal, its not about the journey. Why bother with extra information for the human to understand
So we agree. So waste of characters, pixels & time adding *Robot voice* for each relevant message?
I was dispointed I was trying to get him to say "mother fucker" but I failed
girl - where you go? You were there one min & next you were gone like some sort of ninja
Anyone be up for playing No Man's Sky tonight?
Its only £15 on sale right now & I hear its actually a fun game now
He is one of favourite artists right now
Remember we went to his gig
Been wanting to see it again but sell out quickly
Be good for you to listen to his new EP called "The station"
There is a lot of variables in there
Ruby god has stated incorrect fact. The Rubycon Religion will fall
The followers wont want to commit their code to rubycon anymore
They will just use their computers for bitcoin mining instead
Ruby Revolution has dropped before it started
Rubycon has compiled a error
*Robot voice* Pizza is not goid input data, Oneothrix neverpoint is.
Please address your inputs
Rubycon out
*Chris Jones speaking* Im looking forward tomorrow when its cooler its fucking hot today
what weather like in NYC?
Oh Samir you hitting on me?
The god has been informed
It does pretty much sum up the film actually
The problem with AR/VR/MR, etc there isn't one solid use case or problem it solves yet
Whoever figures out will be very rich
It is tech for sake of tech. Just because you can make dinosairs doesnt mean you should?
I wanna get these socks with Ruby's face on it
Sell them to his followers
Window licker gone wrong
with my own face or your face on them? *Robot voice* Be specific with your declaration and interaction with humans
Keep roaring & the lions will come
The contextual mechanics/gameplay & story looks really exciting to me for RDR2
Be interesting how relationships are built & interactions with characters in your gang
I remember animal hunting was a big part of RDR1, O wonder how they evolve that?
Ruby logic
*Robot Voice* animals are pointless entities
Anyone fancy going for a drink tonight?
Where you flying to?
Ruby god knows his limits & self aware
Just watched Howard the Duck just as bad awesome as flash
The god has spoken
There was alot of strange stuff in there & that was the least remarkable
It was masterpiece
Mac & me?
Howard the duck ticked all the boxes, duck rape, interspectics romanic/porn, dark overlords blowing up nuclear plants,
God has spoken and may of declared some facts which yet to be confirmed
Lion dollars?
Anyone up for a beer tonight?
Ok will be at Mudfark in 15 mins
Oh really? Oh ruby
You in NYC?
Cool :)
Yeah indeedo
With a better airbnb
With a higher budget
Where you staying at Samir oh dear's?
Or a ruby approved airbnb?
Yeah to which Question?
I thought declarion & precision was your thing
Very good Samir. Very precise
*Robot voice* Ruby declaring false facts called  jokes
Blair fire project
A wise man once said joined the video chat.
I can imagine being on fire to be quite sacry
scary
and relatable
I afraid I don't. but I'm sure attactive people do, being hot and all
I mean its relatable fear being set on fire
I guess you're are the word wizard
I guess it is if you're terrorist
Wasn't Rocky 4 was America vs Russia? Or was that Rocky 5?
With "Eye of the tiger" song?
Doesn't the Russian punch Apolla to death?
What silly hats is there?
Silly hats are great
I hate getting back from holiday. The return to the reality
The life of a god
You should love that logic
Ruby anaylsing movie plots for improved logic
Anyone up for a drink tonight?
The ruby god has declared his position
Who bought Blippar?
Vegan n us
What?
Is that a god thing?
2bh I never really seen eye to eye with Eddie. To me, he was another Phil. I'm sure he is lovely person outside of work but inside, quite frankly a bumwipe.
Its hard to tell if it was App team I didn't gel with or political situations surrounding it, as I felt just throw under the bus many times and no one had my back. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike him. Just don't have anything to say to him.
I wish it was that simple
Mega kill who?
Oh Ruby Samir oh dear
Im amazed that they are able to put it off.
With successful businesses, there is always some dealing under table that public will never know about.
Maybe investors like Rish's bum and want a ride. Maybe they investing to get hands on previous contract Blippar has signed with another business
My point is that we don't know why investment has been made/ what they are investing for. You don't have declare why or how much by law
By law, you have declare how you make your money for tax purposes, just it
thats it
So Blippar is breaking the law?
Yeah I worked on project slingshot, connect & interstellar, they were all bollocks
I actually got a date tomorrow
She might be blind tho
That would be werid to date a "Ruby"
Yeah I've given up the donkey talk
I've been attempted many times at work, but decided to still linear/more normal conversations
stick to linear/normal conversations
Yeah indeedo. I personally find most linear conversations boring - "whats your fav colour?", "Ben kissed Wendy". I'm like who gives it shit? How is that important?
We have more important topics to discuss
What would be a good cow replacement for the future of the earth for the scale & grow of the human population whist producing less pollution as well as being socially acceptable? Because eating panda burger wouldn;t go down too well.
Kangoroo would be good one maybe
Could you scale Kangaroos to replace cows?
I'm going to cry in my pants, you're saying I'm linear!
For most people that is non-linear
Maybe this is how you get your Rubyicon Religion out there
Suing for $4 billion
WTF
The Internet is bollocks, I've learnt to take it all with pinch of salt. Neverless great story tho
Just email from Blippar in regards of P11D, anyone else get this email?
Does this mean they are getting sold?
We receive some monies
?
For what purpose tho? As tax for salaries we received
Im glad its a real email
Oh ruby
Maybe legally they have send to you for that year for tax declarion
Huh?
Are you declaring variables?
Huh?
I'm confused. rewind
I don't understand the context, why you say that?
I was talking about the reason for email from Blippar
You're really plugged in. Are you coding or drugging?
It went alright, just no spark or energy, nice girl but not my type really
I have another one lined up next week
Well said Ruby god
He is a god. You should kneel
Its "Strong" not "Weekes"
Happy Bday tall one!
Fuck you Zeus
Im at Athens
Its raining as soon as I get there
Yeah tell me about it
I always think of movie '76 for Northern Ireland
Pretty good film
"Kiss me girl up"
Is there any animal sounds in the track?
No suprise there, Progidy have been crap since never outgunned album (whatever it was called)
Outgunned album was a pop dance album, but it was very good & polished
The problem with their new stuff, they trying to recreate their old sound. With outgunned, he accepted that he wasnt prodigy anymore just in name to sell it.
Maybe he run out of drugs
?
Yeah there isnt much to scream about when you are millionaire
Maybe it is related to poltics with his music label, produce what they want to sell records
Yeah I agree with you. He could broaden & do more & move on
Or lose touch
Ok you know what I mean. The business is making & selling music, just the models has changed.
Yeah they are awesome live
I quite like it although it is old skool
I remember him live at field day oh wow it was intense
I personally dont get it Die Antwoord
Its like slighty edgey version of lady gagu
Visually they are cool. Music wise meh for me
Just not into pop music. Women complian about being objectified in the media & buy Britney Spears. There is no substance or depth to it, look at my tits.
That type of pop music anyway
Yeah I know what you mean. My connection is the fact they use shock tactics & visuals aspects to stick out
Amy winehouse is the only female pop artist I can think of who was indivdual & actual feminist in a punk way.
Who wasnt about getting her tits out
Where are you Ruby?
Yeah its pretty interesting & middle class. I think you would enjoy this festival
Its not at the book club anymore, probably not hip hop enough
Does he look like abit of me & Rubage?
Funny that :)
I wonder who is more Hippie or fat between Ruby & myself?
How do you know his name is Nick Jones?
You are french, could you just say "doing this for a artistic masterpiece"
Funny thing is that I dont think I've even seen a french person wear a berret. Its become world fashion thing like those blue worker jackets that are quite cool.
Looks awesome! I think short movie approach fits his style of film marking more than Hollywood judging by his last two films
District 9 was awesome. I wonder why that so magical compaired to his other films? Lots of pre-production planning & iteration or Peter Jackson? Hollywood you have to make your film in 90 days so it's cost so much per day, maybe it isnt for him.
Yeah I like "This War of Mine",  its certainly something different. I need to get back to playing it. Its very emo & hard work and requires you to reflect which not many games do. Good , not stop playing Farpoo, play that instead
Yeah Indeedo, usually it's the good business ones who can buy the time/resources to recreate that magic again but it's rare to reach that level again/keep up with the business needs I guess
Farpoo is a more suitable name for the game series now
Just like I was saying before, Ubi Sort sand box games are like 5 years behind the competition, I guess they aren't bad, they just lack ambition. Tick all the boxes so to speak
you should play more indie games like "this war of mine". That's what I'm saying, give you ideas for Ruby on wheels or whales
Zelda is amazing, still playing it
Playing Prey too
Fair enough
This is on my list, still need to play last guardian which is meant to be quite simlair
Its very much "Less is more" type of game. Build around your emotions & the feel rather features
I've come across this. I'm actually tempted to buy it: 
Just tell them that you're "The ruby god" and they will give free access for life
The sad reality is the world isn't govnered by facts but ideas who want to believe in.  Religion or Trump being a perfect examples
*ideas we want to believe in
Crazy that someone made this game so current. Bummer that people can voting Tory won't play this game, its playing for my own values which seems abit self wank.
When?
Could do hostel or Airbnb as Manchester is cheap right?
were you talking about Edinburgh festivial with Tara's sister too? Or was that someone else? I partied too way much this weekend, everything has blurred
No way I'm Begbie. I'm more spud for sure
Yeah it's in August, its quite pricey for hotels, etc but I hear Edinburgh festivial is awesome
I do drugs & emo like Spud
That's my typical interview technique which is why still at RippAR
Although I'm improving. Certainly playing the numbers, I have another interview for another company tomorrow
When it rains, really pours as I have possible another 3 opportunities (although early stages), let's chat on phone type deal
Normally I probably tell you "Fuck off" but you're probably being serious
knowing RippAR and all
That is actually a good use case
if they can pull it off
yeah true but if they could solve that problem, that would be useful for blind people
but the tech is too limited currently for that
Personally always thought Blippar should be used in art galleries. The paintings are perfect markers aren't they?
You never want to spend on the audio guides, just get that stuff for free
I have a mac (from RippAR) and PC laptop
Do two seats at once
Fuck this is niche with only 216 reviews
The video is so bad!
Should run well, it came out in 2013
its only a fiver, that is a pint
"Turn on the Ruby Shelds"
You reply "They aren't ruby shields, they are pulse deflector shelds"
That does sound like alot of fun
We should do it. Although I think Manchester & Edinburgh should do them too
I meant we should plan to go to these places Ruby God
in the real world
With regards of the name of my spaceship, Donkey Whale
Space Whale
Fuck me
Probably why I'm been single for most of my life, stuff like this and Pokemon cards
been into some geeky shit in my day
Tempted to email them "Do you get the girl included?" 
That space suit looks pretty cool actually
Yeah indeedo
Looks pretty cool actually
Anyone fancy Film club or a beer tonight?
To be honest Mindhorn doesn't look funny to me, the whole spy comedy has been done to death. I'm up for Red Turtle (Studio Ghibli animation film) at 8.50pm or Guardians 2 at 6pm (its abit early). Alternatively I'm happy to your house if you're up for that?
Fair enough. Red Turtle any good? Let's do your house, what time? Wanna come?
Seems to be tone or style they go as I thought that was like "The Wind Rises" & "The Tale of the Princess Kaguya" were like that. I remember seeing Wind at the Green man festival. I ended up crying in a field, I found it to  be very emotional film
Beatniks Boissonnet How is the new job going? It's always hard to starting a new job, alot to learn & process
Yeah it can abit lonely at first. I used to do freelance work but no one wants to talk to as you're just temp which was one of the reasons that put me off doing it despire the money.  I guess it takes time to get know people, maybe start with "the donkey talk", it's a good ice breaker although people never intend let it go. RippAR crew talk about donkeys more than I do
Yeah indeedo
Donkey talk is quite rock n roll/wild card maybe just talk about berrets or bread. People would engage but not raise their eyebrows in shock
Unusual buy for them, it's not edgey game or anything. I wonder if they bought them for their tech rather than IP?
Looks like something from a alien invasion movie
Been looking forward to this game for a while
Looks great
We went to Ruby's at Coney Island in NYC. Ruby was delighted & started going through my bag for condoms.
So dont take Nick to any Ruby related stores. He gets abit excited
Yeah sounds fun. How much are the tickets?
£50 - im sure its worth it
2 hours freelance in London
Anyone for field day this weekend? Alpex twin is playing
Samir love's?
Nah probably get one tonight or tomorrow but dont wanna go alone
May bring Wendy lovehand & my pet donkey
They only need a single ticket
So you're not coming?
Same price as a bag of subtances
The same price as going with blind sex worker
Same price as wank posh fish n chips which been blessed by a vegan
Good Ruby
How?
Oh Ruby
I wonder if Indy is in there? Running around saying "it belongs in a museum"
He is my grandad
That is annoying. I had a game idea using those type of mechanics
He beat me to it
So who is going to field day?
He needs a slab, he is fucking dumbshit
This is coming from me. I never have anything bad to say about anyone
It was being promatic about it as I feel have a fair point, the risk is high if you fuck it up.
Yeah exactly
Cheers big ears. Someone has to care about releasing things which actually work
There is no release or quality control which makes RippAR look like ShitAR
Just tried being talked to like asshole, I've doing this job for 3 years
I'm leaving soon anyway so Fuck it
Wowzer really? Maybe they have beer googles on. I keep getting that I look like Robert web from peep show
Personally wise you're defo Jeremy
I'm more like Mark who never gets any
Really? he gets all of the ladies
you get all ladies I mean
You're abit crackhead but not that crackhead
Thanks, not sure if i want to get AIDS yet
Oh dude, then you wonder why I get any? With your stunts
On that matter, what is wrong with being safe? Condoms are wonderful
What sort of wingman are you? Naughty Ruby
You been downgraded to Booby
Nick Booby
Surely Condoms would protect me from "The Aids"?
Oh Booby
What time you guys are getting to field day?
Forest swords at 3.15pm, probably get there for 2.30
Only takes me 40 mins to walk there so I meet you guys there
Yeah im up for after party although have to stay off the juice. Ive been hangover all week
Was the video from Sam's wank bank?
Melody at Field day?
I hear it's very good festival although in sept
Is anyone going into the office tomorow? Im thinking fuck that
Or is that being parnoid? The likelyhood of anything happening again is as likely as seeing a flying donkey
Despire how much I would love to see a flying donkey with wings doesnt make it feesable
In the realms of reality
yeah true
I like to go Sonar but there is so planning for flights & hotels, etc whereas UK festivial you just go & bring a tent with you (more simple)
When is Sonar? In week's time right?
I can't wait till all this election bollocks is over. All you read "May" said this, "Jeremy" did this, please fuck off!
Is "May" in it?
Is she lettuce bagging a fox (she can't teabag can she?)
You watched May lettuce bagging a fox or I, Daniel Blake on your Birthday? We have developers in the room & you have to declare & be precise
Games Journalism has some low standards for news. I guess you could argue that for the whole internet, every news provider is making shit up for clicks
That guy was a muppet
the endless space racer has do
has done, need to dig it up. But it wasn't good as the gameplay was boring. The hardest challenge is making the track spawn randomly which is fun to ride but not pertitive or too difficult. Endless games are hard to pull in terms of this balancing
Enviroment is easy. Just make 10 to 20 parts of a level which spawn randomly and just need to test that looks good pieced together. For example, does piece 4 blend with piece 15?
If you are racing and go going faster, you can always use blur effects to stop the player anaylsing the background or environment, they are too busy focusing on the track
Great minds think alike
endless is a trick
No game is endless, even no man's sky. From a high level, it's 1000 assets used against script to get millions outcomes
My point is that isn't endless in sense what Ruby talking about because it wouldn't be out as a product
Just very clever tricks
What did you think all that "Onion" & "Letture" talk was referring to?
Young uns = Onions, mid aged = Letture
No questions? That is very accepting of you
Lol
Probably changing to blend in with everyone else to go but this video during the attacks or after the fact?
WTF? Anti mass immigration & pro europe, what you talking about? You have fucked up vision of the world. Been clearly teabagged by your dad
His dad
Those robot arms are awesome, I want some
Viginia is on my very long list of games to play
Is it american or japanese production? Cowboy Bebop is amazing, one of fave shows ever
Anyone up for film night tomorrow night?
1st world problem - holiday planning for July, not sure where to go? San Fran? Indonesia > Bali? Berlin?
7ish I would say. Come my place if you like, working from home tomorrow so could do eariler
You can come afterwards if you like. Usually Lion is roaring & Samir is oh dearing
you happy to do Thursday instead?
Wed or Thursday?
We go on a double date on Thursday, been looking for a excuse to declare my love to Samir
*We could go on a double date
spoken like a true romantic
That would interesting watch, watching a lion groom
Do they?
I looks like Vincent is fingering my ear in that photo
Never had a pet actually
Just petted other people pets
Frog Girl is right, you can get good money for manes in Africa. rRch assholes wear them as hats. here is an alternative revenue stream for you - Ruby Maneing Enterprises
It was very nice dog and she looked like she deserved respectable & friendly greeting
I have to say this conversation is amazing, I haven't laughed so hard in a while
maneing when you remove mane from a wild cat
My approach would be either: 
A.) Build a bond with a wild cat and when it trusts you and it is asleep. Just do a stealth shave   
B.) Form an agreement with the wild cat with exchange of goods like red meat for it's mane  
C.) Just bash it over the head and get it done quickly
A.) Gets some toys and befriend the cat 
B.) You have learn cateese and speak to the cat
These 3 options, you only need do every maneing
per maneing
Yes
Or it could be a verbal agreement
Meoowwww
Which means "yes" in cateese
Meeeeooooooooooooowwwwww means "give me food you asswipe!"
You are certainly looking for faults in business plan for Ruby Maneing Enterprises
Oh Ruby you don't like this business idea
?
Ruby you could become the cat whisler. What a skill
I mean whisperer
Cat whisperer
Film night at tomorrow at my place?
you up for coming along?
Animation is hard work. Average Animator at Pixar does 12 frames per day
Pixar is one of the best in the world so their standards are really high
E5 9GB
Really?
Fuck off
Craziness
You want to come over tomorrow?
lol oh dear
Oh Ruby
Huh?
Oh fuck off
Yes good
ruby whY?
I have better things to do that sort that bollocks out
Well done 
You're not being a twat for once, you're being a God
In other words, you're being responsble grown up & should of left ages ago as you're too good for RippAR
Sorry if It sounded rude, that wasnt my intention. I was trying to encourage postivity & praise your abilities
I did never said "all the time"
I love that but also I think you could make (develop) awesome things henre the title of "Ruby God"
Thats why you are a god
Further lion fan love or trolling whatever you want to call it
Face profile works, shock horror after only 8 months
Maybe I should ask Tara to use that image as marketing material
Market it towards animal lover
lovers
If the question is what the user case is? Fuck knows, Blippar way, let's make some tech and make up the use case as we go along. But functionality wise, you can attach content to your face. So for example, I can upload a videos, images or web links to my face and then you scan my face, you can access to that content.
I can imagine people might do for celebrities - would be interesting to see personal content/things they like.
It's just so limited and lack any self expression
Which again great tech but terriable use case/experience
Yeah pretty much. There been plenty of time on it, just not used effectively. Just no project management or plan or alot of hidden agendas especailly Bangalore & MV
I actually used to like Blink 182 in the 90s & 00s. I'm amazed they still going, last few albums have been awful
Yeah I know, there been alot of politics and power games around it. So MV and Banglore offices get more control and resources for whatever
Whole QA team in London been affected by this
I know people worked at Testology, they are awful company
Makes Blippar look wonderful
Alot of AAA games companies are similar but whole industry is growing up and becoming more humun
human
That is Blippar's model is B2B not B2C
I think they will never do B2C well with Steve around
He is too behind the times. SeeFood app is fun but it's 5 years too late
Gone of the days where I got a app that does this. You need an app with actual use case/user journey with a purpose
Its trying to be funny and wacky
Who/what is talking tom?
Why for so much? Does it have a huge userbase?
It's the IP
Sure but what I'm saying that investor doesn't spend $1 billion on an app, it's IP they want. Which created by the app.
That's same for every product, you have get lucky that is just common sense. I think it's about making a good product and understanding your audience/who it is for which increases your likelyhood of catching on & making it easier to market.
Bemo does seem better in that sense. Actual use case and understand who they want to use it
What if find that reflexing and uplifting
Might work against you especially dealing these power hungry sociopath types
lol
I might actually go with elephants if I was in politics as elepants are the icons of being "Left" in the states
Whereas Donkeys are "Right" the conservatives
Do you think I would get extra points if I got Samir riding an elephant for the message? Or it's more liberal if I paint myself brown and say "Colour don't matter, it's state of mind"
yeah tell me about it
probably 5 people who got confused
keep submitting over and over
Maybe lots of Ruby God fans
Yeah I had Steel Battalion such hardcore & stressful game I played it like twice. I had to sell as it take too much space
Great concept
Results will come in at 11pm tonight they say
Oh I see
The ruby has spoken
Going to Jermeny party tomorrow?
Its on FB
Victory Rave
Yes not walker twat
indeedo you are right there
In VR it would be perfect
22 seats for Labour
11 for tories
Why?
Watch it in real time
Seems hopeful at least. Been up researching holidays - Thinking Thailand Bangkok July
1 week in BK then 1 week in phuket (Beach)
Yeah a week to recover
Oh really? You dont recommend Phuket?
No sexy times with the sex workers. My dick will fall off
So you up for Thailand?
I wish I was as liberal as my friend Shaun who would grab all prostitutes & say "its cheaper than girlfriend"
He is probably right
"Alright love, I'm Chris Jones.  How's your onion? Probably abit raw isnt? From all of your bouncing"
So Thailand?
You declaring functions again? Trying to come up with a system? No there is no system to life
28/21 tories are catching up
Just got a website open
Refresh it every few mins
35/23
What a race
Surely most seats = majority no?
I see. That was what happened with tories & lib demos back in 2008 or whatever
Or was it 2010?
Thats a book waiting to happen to form social idealogy/way of life
Interesting seeing the live map
No its a live feed
So on more important topic; thailand?
BBC = British Bollocks Cunts
They are biggest liars out there along with the daily mail or the sun
51/31
BBC are scared?
Same with channel 4 but they are owned by tories
True
When I was at BeefJack, they were possible client. Interesting company
Channel 4 I mean
Just entertaiment industry is filled with middle class entitled twats which is more of the problem
As its only those who can afford to work in TV so creativity or political becomes very one sided
This is one of the 1st times Ive actually cared who wins. Maybe it is a age thing, care outside of oneself
56/39
Bernard = Twat
Entitlement is the word. Walks around if the world would be broken without him
I had to work with him and Melody. They were both nightmares, playing politics & blaming QA for their lack of product management knowledge. If I didn't have to work them, I would probably may of liked them
Basically the two sums up the people of Blippar, they are more interested in their gains & bumming up senior management
Yeah that too
When is this Monzo event? I have to do family stuff this weekend :(
Duty calls I guess. Usually have show my face once every 6 months
Cool maybe I should get one actually, as I do intend travel around alot
Going to Thailand in July
not yet
Probably do it on Sunday
You mean the weather? Its their rain season but cooler & les busy
less busy
Are you getting a commission?
You guys should watch "planet of the apps" which is dragon's den with app start up pitching their app ideas, some are quite next gen
it's a show produced by Apple
Can't do tonight, duty calls. But I won't want to go to mud fart anyway
what is verdict?
Tories wankers in again?
So yes
She won't care belong she gets paid, she doesn't care happens for the UK
Pure indiviudialism, if she sees a better deal she is off. Probably write a book "How to make lots of money in poltics and fuck foxes"
I always wondered why we still have a royal family? One of my theories is they have dirt on everyone, so everyone just stays in line and let them do what they want
lol indeedi
indeedo
One of other theories is they are paid directly by lord of commons as distraction/entertainment. "The queen has a big nose" rather focusing on the what is really going on.
I guess FB is new version of gladiators isn't? To control your society and entertainment distraction. There is quote from some Roman general saying (along the lines of): "Keep people fed, entertained and happy, stop raiding & upset"
Yeah exactly that
Wasn't your one more modern version of the Roman quote as surely they didn't have circuses then
?
Although Romans were pretty progressive and next gen for their time, They had hot water & government system in 200 BC or something
Out of the seriousness, that was amazing for that time
I enjoy history actually
Which is why I call you a "God" you could make history
Commodore Android device thing?
Is there rave & club events next weekend we are planning on going to? Cousin from australia is here & wanna take her out to party. She is 27 & single
Also
I didnt realise you had your own show
I can't say if she is fit or not as she is family, so please no teabagging. Nah she is quite normal
What club should we go on Friday or Satrusday?
Underground place? The nest?
It's not that impressive
Did you go with your dad?
Oh Ruby god
Yeah I can see you are geeking out
I dont know
I only see her like once every 7 years
Only slaggy if she agrees, no rapey
Your a god, you have your own set of rules
What is wrong with you?
Natasha
Trying to sort her some fun, I wasn't thinking rape or a four way
Then again this is all Ruby logic
I have to look after her so no bloodied Jeans
So where should we go clubbing? Any good events on Cristofaro
Good point, however I dont have any other friends in London anymore
You are sick man
I think Samir & her might get on
You are a sick puppy
Huh?
Oh Ruby god
That is some serious BS my friend
Sounds like you be talking to one of those sex lines
No I mean of those sex chat numbers you call up. I remember seeing adveristed on late cable TV
I dont know if those lines still exist such a 90's/00's thing
I dont keep talking about Rubies. Nick is master of Rubies & keeps talking about it in regards of the real world & the coding world.
Stress test? Is that Ruby god term?
Or like a command to stress everyone out for the lack of action? Why Stress test?
You said "Stress Test", Im asking why you said that?
String entered
I was talking about nightclub events on Friday. Maybe to god as yourself that warhammer & clubbing are pointless attempts of escapism with fantasy power plays in a set  enviroment.
One of the same thing
So you want to one of those events on Friday?
So that is  a "No"
Booking tickets for myself & my cousin. Otherwise you end waiting in a line for 2 hours to get in or just dont end up going nowhere good
She is a tourist, want to take her to a proper London club/night out
Down under is simlair to America where night clubs arent really a thing or dance music. That was what suprised the most about NYC actually
We tried many times, we couldn't try find any or get in
Its more of a bar type city
Even NYC locals from Blippar didnt really of any good clubs. Its cutural isn't their thing.
Anyway you get my point, nightclubs are typical more of european thing to do
Oh Ruby god, your logic of your world is warped
Not a ruby I've been teabagged used & abused & Im dead experience
Experience where candidate is still alive & at least remember it
The problem with me organising this, I have no idea about clubbing or whats a good club. Which is better Egg, Fabric or corisica Studios?
27
Isnt Fabric where tourists go?
It's like world famious club or whatever?
Oh really?
I go proper clubbing/raving like once a year
So I have no idea
Like last time for me that was bizzare hippy rave we went in
I'm planning it as we speak
Other than people in this channel, thats it as yet
Probably could get my friend Shaun along with some of his mates. She will be gone by then
Leaves on 20th I thino
Think
Isnt been to Egg in ages, is it a big with many floors? Or just one big room?
That is abit south for me, you fancy going somewhere more north in bethanal green or London Fields way?
You talking about today or Friday?
No you just said "Samwise is here, thinking of beers in wapping direction"
I said "Anywhere more North"
Wapping is too far for a sunday drink
Thats in Shoredith right?
Shoreditch is alot quicker than Wapping
The Queen of Hoxton is better around the corner as it has a roof
You mean you finish work by 6?
What time should we meet at Queen of Hoxton?
7
Ok sure
You guys going get food out or eating before you go?
Anyone else for a sunday drink? Sam, Frog girl, Lion, Matt?
I think so but there is plenty of other places nearby if not
I always meant to be booking my thailand trip but I cant bothered today
Some beer & sun be good
Have you left yet?
Cristofaro - Basically want to take my cousin who is from Australia (tourist to London), a good london nightclub on Friday. You have recommendations?
you wanna come/go this Friday somewhere?
There is this one  but it's on Satursday instead, I see if she is fir nights of partying, maybe do Friday as chilled one at the pub with RippAR and Sat for the the hardcore rave
Im on the rooftop now
Yeah its not till next year now :(
E3 is looking good, you guys seen anything you dig? I look forward "the Evil within 2", I really enjoyed 1st one
XOYO any good? I havent been there in years
I was thinking to go Shoreditch as its so typically london/hipster
XOYO is in old Street right? So we do a few bars in Shoreditch on the way
OK shall we go to XOYO on Friday then?
Annoying the ticket you preorder you have to get there before 10.30pm for XOYO. Maybe we should buy on the door, unless we go for all of the night
?
New pirate sailing game by Ubisoft
Living like a true god
Can you rename the room to Ruby's Lair?
Reminds me of flashback or another world you remember those games?
Is it Xbox One game only?
Ruby Rape
You seen the mario rabbits X-com game? looks likegreat fun
Yeah true but bizzarely comes together really well. Solid mechanics & game design
Look at that bright side, May could get booted as she cut the public services, fire, police and NHS
Another political spin for Labour to get in, whatever that is fair or not is another matter. It's politics game (aka game of thrones)
Surey a building like that should have fire water system which would be out the fire automatically
Cheap building construction
Build during in 50's probably
The tories become "The workers Party"?
Fuck me
looks quite intense
7 people are leaving this month including myself
10% of the London office
Yeah it was real shame about Safari
It was actually one of best products made out of Blippar
Gilbert
Rumours for that Sam whitehead is going too
If there is a ship left, its sinking
Thagaya is coming to visit the London office but coming on a Sunday, that is so RippAR
Its will be interesting to see how things play out in the next 12 months
If they float or sink
GameJam via RippAR or going to GameJam event?
Leaving present for Mike
I wish I could record people reactions as walkby. Some people are so freaked out
Is there like CCTV app that record footage but take films 4 frames per second to save battery and memory. We need a app like this to film people's reaction using a mobile phone to record
lol
Jeff just walked by and you can tell that he just trying to igrone mike pix
Java is used for Android development
Its down to the company/what's their dev cycle/tech is, etc as you get alot of games/VR that use C++ & C, as well
Good Luck matt, that be both good for learning and the wallet
Alright Ruby god!
Well I don't have database access to your knowledge bank, your brain isn't open source yet
I think myself & Ruby could make good characters in 2D beat em up or wrestling
In there any gameplay for it yet?
Share a link
The studio who making it has such high level of creativity, I wish more AAA studios were like that. Rayman Origins &  Valiant Hearts were just 2D beauties
Michel Ancel probably helps ytoo
Nah
-Why are you there? Apart of some form of artistic expression? Death is beaut
You can watch it now too
what time you finish last night?
you going back to NYC in sept/Oct?
time
Radu twin sitting next to me
He was like hipster version of Radu, I was going to chat him to see if sounded like Radu but just want to risk it
Wasn't that game made by Smash TV guy?
I Bought Resogun but I didn't get into it
Are you Hamlet?
You seen her interviews, she was really funny and outspoken
abit of a crazy one
That wouldn't surprise me, Pink Floyd are so iconic & unique
Not sure if I would say their music was timeless as it does sound very 70's (very prog rock) but I think people will listen/but their music
They are kings of that whole prog rock genre (if you can call them that)
Like Nine Inch Nails with industrial rock although NIN isn't no pink floyd in terms of impact
You have led zeppelin who could agrue is better than Pink Floyd although I find Floyd more accessable & bizzare in a good way
I found led zeppelin hard work
- Don't get me wrong NIN are awesome, just not sure if they will remembered like Pink Floyd
2bh its like comparing popularity & impact of cheese vs crackers
How is glaston pal?
*Northern accent*
Manchester times
In the whole of Manchester, last night we ended up going the gay village. Samir & Ruby were culture shocked
Ta pal
I had to fit in to the whole scene like
Oh fuck off pal, you da wished you had my hat
Nah with you Ruby Pal
It was great weekend, nice to get away from london for a bit
So funny! Such a ruby god thing to do
Just booked F13 seat for baby driver on Wednesday
I will be in Thailand then. May try to watch it in Thai
No face rape
more rape
Can you pre-order anywhere yet?
You should go
Its OK Ruby we know all that you're after my bum. Taking photos of me every day, cock blocking me, taking to me to the gay village. Im trying to free you & get you to embrace your true self
I would like girls hands or arms around my shoulders rather the stuff you put on them
I would prefer
The chain is only as strong as its weakest link
Lol
Love is hard game to play si it is a big burden
Where can you/could you preorder?
Really? I tried many stores, its not there
Talking to Mateja and there is no luck as you say Ruby God unless its a con
Banyard Tyler Beatniks Boissonnet - Up for my leaving drinks this friday?
Bring him along. Good to break him in with the London ways
Rather talking about farming
You're not filling me with much confidence
As we will end up Shadwell at some point but we need to do something before then
I hear you can just buy tickets on the door
So we probably just have some drinks in London Bridge then head to Dalston & see where the night takes us. 3am no doubt end up in Shadwell
Like I say we need to do something before Shadwell
Unless we stay at office till 12am
So what is the plan for location? People keep asking me where
where/when/how?
Asking me about the leaving party
What if they don't know who you are
?
You're a god so they may find you unapproachable
Its like speaking to the Queen or Kind
King
Being a ruby god, you have to power to declare your visitor as useless or non-logical which is scary
In their mind, you could be like queen of hearts
cut off their heart without any remorse
head sorry but heart sounds better
I think it makes perfect sense for your nick name as it sums you up well but you refuse to understand the logic of my reasonings
Are we visiting a farm or a bar?
Just trying to manage people's exectations, cause it could be anything with you
Exactly
Out of the seriousness, you have something planned right? So just tell people to talk to you?
Ok Ruby
Yeah its awesome film
a classic
Nah I won't even be that posh
I think I will end up with 5 cats or dogs
like crazy cat or dog man
where is everyone?
Im at shitlark
Where?
Been there
Done that
No ruby
You upstairs?
Thamasside
Coming now god
Rape
I wonder if the AI creators give this personality to the AI? Or the AI just came up with itself (own style of humour)?
Yeah its pretty funny tho
I knew you were a god
oh dear
Just watched Baby Driver, awesome film. Highly recommend a watch :)
Lol
They are cows
Pigeons & cows are quite simlair to terms of behaviour & mentality. Just mindless animals moving around without any aim or focus
The Ruby god has spoken
Quoted "all animals are dumb"
Why am I getting raped?
Getting it back?
Funny timing, just had for two jabs for prevention of various diseases in southeast Asia. Its interesting how digital world shares alot in common with the real world
Makes you quite parnoid
Are you in the office today?
I didnt know, how long you in Devon for?
Oh Ruby God
Going to Thailand tomorrow, get there Wednesday. If you don't hear from me for 3 weeks, im not dead. Just in Thailand
Not sure if they have internet
Oh Ruby God
you're next prpject
Project
Trolling adventures episode 3
Did you have writter's block? Not much trolling is happening right now. I guess a true artist, wait for a moment to have something to say
2bh all companies are run by wankers, just whatever if you put up their shit. My advice is become your boss if you can.
Went to thai boxing event last night, it was so intense. It was live on TV too.
You will love it here, you should go
Probably like to go Thailand again but in the winter cause so hot
You can rent anything you want. Its werid, guys walk with menus of their options, its pretty fucked up.
I hope baby driver actually makes some money, most of  his films recently have flops especailly scott pirgram vs world. Alot of people just didnt get it
ZappAR is probably having the simlair problems as RippAR to having repeatable & simple to maintain business model/vision. Just AR hasnt got a good use case yet. Only difference is that RippAR is better at selling & marketing
Anyway back to elephant riding & lady boy bagging
Funny that, I may go to Japan in October. I was planning to go to Japan instead of Thailand but too pricey. Foxes are really cute, I hear that there is island in Japan filled with 1000's of foxes somewhere
Hunting is the wrong word, interaction or communication with foxes would be cool
Foxes as animal I mean. The foxes you are referring to. Oh yes the hunt is on if you are around
Samir oh dear trolling episode 5
So who is the victim? Anywhere to get him on the show
To really add to the drama
I'm glab you're using your database of ny face for good use
Digital terrorism
You photoshop that right?
I would be cool to have a Chris Jones as a DJ
Yup I met a few. They were all evil. Just plain & dull & souless
One I met was at the same company I worked at too
If I came a dictator, I may just kill them all making me the one & only
Legally speaking not mentally
Yeah lol "The Chris Jones"
I wonder my villian will be "The logic bones"?
Thailand is fulled with tack in the best way
Thai pop is so bad
I keen the CD case so O can treasure it forever
Yeah lol
I bet she loves it tho?
Its all game of control. Whatever you do the goverment or coprations control you in on any position of the eco ladder - poor, mid or richy
You would love brothels here
Not quite but also
Maybe if lion boy became spotty like teenager
I've send fan mail to lionboy already but here they love lions more us europeans
They are everywhere
Via icons & images, not psyhically
Wild Cats & dogs are everywhere but they are very friendly
Yeah I seen some but not many
Went to monkey show, I felt ill afterwards
Cant believe that shit goes on, I had to see it for myself never again
Monkeys with foxes? Yeah that be crazy
In rivers, you see turtles & snakehead fish
Wrong video :(
There is lots of buttleflies too
Animals are great herw
here
Hammocks are amazing
Hanmocks are amazing
So underrated
Have you slept in hanmock?
Its next gen sleepage
I was fucked last night
Not sure how I feel about this.
Just craziness, I could pay £12 to fire 10 rounds from a M16
Thailand just have no concept of safety, anything goes
Its a M4 sorry
This sounds like awesome idea
£37 for 10 shots
That is ladyboy
Its gone to another level/realm of possibility
Thai man
This is what scares me. In Thailand, safety isnt a thing, they are so care free its amazing
So probably wont show me how to hold it or fire it
Probably give me a gun & thats it
Just why?
Yeah I will need animal interaction fix when im back in the UK. Donkey Sanctuaty
Sounds simalir what they do in Thailand with elephants. Walk & feed them
They keep asking for you & Samir
Wagner will jump, he is very good QA. He isn't a manager so it be good for day to day testing stuff but also can test plans (more advanced QA lead stuff)
So what? I thought you were gay when I 1st started as you keen asking how I was
When have I nor done "hate"?
"Hate" isnt in my dictionary
My dictionary or my emotions are quite limited
I miss these conversations
Coming from the "Ruby god"
On a different topic, you need to come thailand you're love it
Should do it next year in Jan perhaps
Indeedo
Nah its their high season
Its more like going a tour in jungle during the day to interact with some bizzare animals, go to back civilisation, get high in some Thai drug you never hear of, party on beach, get on tuk tuk to try to back to hotel, then end up on another beach to sleep. Get woken up by a monkey trying to mug you for food & realising you are spooning some random white girl which cant remember what happened nor their name. Repeat
Banyard Glad you dig the pictures/images of the adventures
Sometimes I feel like abit of peter as most girls are like 19
The only silver lining for Face, its good for building a good team despire how useless "face" as a feature is. With games, you build 10 games, only release one, good teams can take years to build especailly if the products are techincally ambitious
I feel sorry for Wagner, he been testing it for the past 8 months & probably still broken
Samir Oh Dear - what are you talking about?
Oh Strong Ruby - what a combo of nonsense
You're raping Wagner now?
Poor guy
Jelly?
I can eat me?
You can eat me sordy
Sorry
"His day in the sun" how is getting digitally raped getting some sun?
Fucking tory cunts
Poor kid, she is a business woman l like it
Hope she made more £150 to make a profit
Who is rapey?
I shot 9mm pistol yesterday, fuck its scary. I dig the smell of the smoke & shell casing popping out. Its quite hard to be accurate, alot of recoil
One thing off the list for things I've never done
Tomorrow is rafting & driving ATV, never done those before.
Nah actually it was super un-thai health & safety
The guy was standing next to me to ensure I dont shot off target
I have this for you instead
This is on the street You love patong. Its Thai version of Las Vegas but more dirty
This street is crazy. First 30 seconds is abit crap, poor camera work sorry about that. Later in the video you will see craziness, its so intense in a good way
No fear in Thailand mate
Video is taking awhile to upload. The internet is poo in this hotel
Uploading videos or shouting about kings?
They really love their King. I went to see "planet of the apes" last night (V.good film btw) & before the film, they had 3 mins footage of the king's highlights of his life with his favourite song playing. Everyone had to stand up to show respect for his death.
So odd but very respectful
I was going to film it but I didnt want to offend the thais
It was really epic with really awkward shots
Awkward long shots
Yeah you should become film director
& start to make bizarre art films like that shit film we watched
Oh Ruby god
That planet coaster looks great. Such high production values for a sim game, the style & animation is lovely
Actually been thinking about writting my own biography & call it "God spotter - avoidance of dying & awkward encounters with Chris Jones"
I hate all british celbries bullshit.
I just dont get why people interested in such talentless twats that do nothing. Judlst famious for being themselves
So bizzare
Who is the girl? His daugher or wife I cant tell?
guys you doing anything tonight?
Headed over where?
Amazing
Im still fucked from last night plus I might going on date tomorrow
I don't have a bike :(
Tempted to buy scooter after Thailabd
Thailand
I think some of these names have to made up although very entertaining
Raped
The date went well
I liked her, alot in common but I don't know if fancy her or not tho
Yeah I did
I talked about rubies & she knew who you were. Ruby god is famious
Just a conversation to get to  know her really
No wank jobs or bonage
this is a deep discussion for animal planet tread
I never go for a meal on a 1st date, just drinks to see if she are what she says she is
Beer she drank
Interesting day :) sucks that I return to the world of work tomorrow
Thanks :) Typically I'm not too excited now, just want to be my boss & do my own thing. I will just ride the wave for the money & hopefully can do my own thing soon.
Oh ruby
Whats with the zoom rape?
The link worked for me, very funny :) I imagined Ruby's cooking to be like that but realised he is normally domansticed
Big business in board games these days
I dont know some board gamers I met are really hardcore, that love complex tabletop games stuff. Its getting quite popular.
Its deadicated hobby, I remember I used spend years playing 2/3 games as used to have so much downtime but these days, I luckly to play one game one hour
Looks like another cold war
There is a documenary I've been meaning to watch about Bobby Fischer who was one of the world's best chess players. He was super genius & abit rock n roll star too
Is he your idol?
He was like a chess logic God
I be more exicited if it was called "The Last Vegan"
Anyone up for the pub tonight? Going to Anchor to meet Wagner
I haven't seen you in months
Come out & do some roaring
You guys with your girlfriends. I just stick with the right hand.
Yeah that be awesome, need to get pay. Im pretty broke right now
Why only one night?
Limp Bizkit wow
I wish it was real
Where you going tonight? I promised my current work that I would play Mario Kart with them so I pop over 8ish 9ish
Sing "Happy leaving Mr Madson"
Please bring the wig
Has no man pants better now?
Is no man's pants better now?
Where are you currently?
Going to leave the office in a bit
The mudfart. What is wrong with you people?
It actually suits him
Looks likeca true builder
He certainly deserves to be listened too, being world pionear with space 9, etc regardless of how crazy his claim may be.
He has a fair point, you should be caution for the possiblies of AI.
I thought it wasnt a real show. I thought it was satire towards Netflix as content platform as that is typical type of programming they do
before you get too excited, im not talking coding or variables
I look like solid snake from MGS 4
That video/story is fucked up. Samir you should that trick
Not with my mum
She is too old & fat anyway
6 years of RippAR ripping souls out of people's chests
Oh Ruby
Yeah another terror attack
is your cousin alright?
Oh dear & on ruby
Oh ruby
I think funny that try make the fishing more intense & exciting with the heavy metal soundtrack
Its anything but that
Ris Junior
Annoyingly I work for the company filled with dudes
I saw the 6 year photo, no one is there
Where are you Ruby god?
Sound like Jeff the Nazi or sound like Ariel Pink?
Ariel Pink is great
Maybe you should ask to join his band being a Ruby fan
his name is pink after all
probably share alot in common
You should listen to his solo stuff
nah this is apart of his main band
This is one of fave songs on the album actually
Sexual Athletics is another great song too
Nah what did it say?
Let me in, im outside
RippAR being humble
You fancy one last drink or film night on Mon or Tues before you leave the UK?
Shit data is quite important for world domination
Ok where you want to go for your last night Samir?
When & where?
Nice guy that security dude but certainly talks. He spoke me his life story
So what is the plan tonight? Film night at Shagwell?
I will come over abit later if that is OK? Like 7ish/8ish
Got alot of work to do today
Grrrawwwww
Roaarr
"i'M Sod man!"
Im dispointed, I thought the video was going to be "Sod Man: the video game"
Let me in.mate
Outside the doors inside
Doors for the lifts mate
Locked
Not sure GOD
WTF
Like the concept - very blade runner. Will try to play it at some point
Oh ruby god!
I'm not into boxing at all but there has been alot of hype around this match
I just see it as a night out, I don't get it too seriously
If two assholes want to beat each other for money, that's up to them.
I personally don't see any difference, just different packaging. Drama for the fight (the purpose) & then they fight in a ring.
Yeah same, basically its like lion and squirrel fighting it out
My plan is I'm having a few people come around my place 8/9ish for games (ps4) & drugs & drink then we going to pub that will show the boxing match.
If you fancy some games come earlier, then people want to see boxing can go & people aren't can go home
what you seeing?
Yeah same. DunKirk was disappointing shallow
I hear Detroit meant to be good
Not sure what to do myself today, anyone up for doing something today?
I told you that those posh wankers like ham!
Yeah indeedo, that is rare these days
Sounds like my type of girl
Very entertaining
:)
Samir oh dear
Any of you guys fancy doing something this weekend?
You going to wear Black or Pink?
A wise man once said voted for "Pink" in the poll.
I think Pink is good colour. People should wear it more especially dudes
Oh dear - Tim Strobl is in NYC or will be soon according to his FB
I come over & watch you play Witcher. Its an awesome game
Story is great. Basically interactive game of thrones
Oh Lion boy
We like each other
I hate all this FB bollocks 2bh
I couldn't be bothered to change/disable it
It will happen. ISIS aren't fucking about are they?
mortage?
Fight of gods WTF
Either a flash in the pan or million seller
I wonder how many people want to beat up Jesus?
You see Ruby is the future & you didnt believe me
That is the best poo story I've even read
I hope its a true story
Yeah I guess its not very sterotypical female thing to do/not very classy or whatever. At least she had the balls to say something although embarressing.
Could of not of said anything although people would wonder why toilet smells of poo
trut that
true that
Any of you guys fancy a beer tomorrow night?
Or wouldn't mind seeing "IT" that is out this weekend too. Seen some good reviews
Just send a email saying Ruby Party & people will come
It would be werid to go RippAR office after all this time. Probably should turn up for Friday but I hear everyone goes home these days
That too
Clark is very good. I saw at a rave at few years, it was awesome
I really like his album from 2014 - called orignally "Clark" although he has like 10 albums
strong - Let me know when you're going. I be happy to join for a few, It's been a long week so I won't be out till 2am
Oh Ruby
You should come so I can roar at you
& for old times sake
Is that a fake FB account I created?
Is he real or apart of your Rubycon matrix?
Tell him to come
I would to see your matrix play out
Ripping or Blipping or are they the same thing?
where was the favourite picture taken? NYC?
I love CHIPS
Yeah I never watch either
You only pay if you watch the BBC
Being a god, you don't need TV
Only datapoints
I am a datapoint?
lol
Weekes Where you going tonight? & When?
Will be leaving work in about 45 I hope
Oh god
which pub?
Thameside is better than mudblock
or cockblock depends how you see it
On my way
wanna see IT at hackney picturehouse at 21.10pm
9.10pm
?
I dont have any clown clothes sorry to break it to you
sounds like a hell of movie
what time you want to meet before the film?
Meet just before the film at 9pm?
Ruby you around tonight?
Fact declared & stored
I throw the balloon in the air after the film ended but no one saw it!
Its funny the girl next to me was more scared than me, she yelled "You fucker" when pennywise pops out in the girl's bathroom scene
lol I thought it was pretty solid film, it was more of ghost train I thought it was going to be. It was very set piece heavy
Actually Gif is quite next gen and sums up my life quite well
Yeah I miss Blippar but It did make me lazy
South London is cheaper but rawer
You will see some stabbing & shooting in Croydon that's for sure. Although I hear it's cleaned up over the last few years
Used to be gotham city
Used to be worse but I've haven't lived there for since 2005, its a long time
Oh ruby
There is a club called "The Blue Orchid" - 
Basically Solid so crew used to play and someone got shot in there, so they had to close it down
Huh?
i remember reading a story how someone in line for the midnight launch one of GTA games, I think it was GTA 4. Anyway a guy got stabbed and everybody thought it was popularity stunt and he died lol
I hear its all changed now
I havent seen Ruby leaving video yet you have it?
Good job Sam. The video is art
I bet alot of people were confused by it
just tell them "I'm a Ruby god!" a good way to gain respect
or "I am Ruby"
with your hands in the air
Did Rish upset them too? Which is why they are using the word Blipp
What's the name of cat? You need learn communicate with the cat to stop doing such craziness
meoooowww
Wasn't that Melody leaving drinks?
I remember that place but I can't remember why we went there
So recent rage
rape
not rage
Show him that and that will inspire him
I thought it was beatles being on a acid trip
Rob you in London?
May go after the LCD Soundsystem gig, going with Gary
Garo powers
Yeah looks great :) Its visually very different for wes - no pinks
its abit of grey/gears of war
Is that Ruby speak?
Im making my way now
His oliver you're new photo buddy?
When will start the database of Oliver's face?
Why didnt bring the family to your new place?
Those poshos love some mamakin action
Poshos in West London I mean
Do another trip with the van
Yeah many memories huh
End of Era
RippAR chapter is over
You guys wanna go to see Blade Runner next weekend?
God has spoken
Where on Thursday?
You have deers in that part of town don't ya?
Posh fancy animals
Deers are hard to interact with. I interacted with some in Germany
Interaction as saying "hello". They did seem confused
I went to Carpenter live last year at halloween, it was great fun :)
The posh life ;)
I knew you had Ruby in you. Just thinking about tonight, not sure if I can afford go to see Blade Runner in central its like £16 a ticket. Would you guys be up for a drink instead?
Weatherspoons somewhere
Let's left it for tonight and do another time
Yeah annoyingly doing house viewings today to rent my flat out
But we do something soon
Maybe go to this?
Reminds of shadow complex. More action/set pieces rather exploration & puzzles than Methoid
Looks good
They are still working on the SDK?
You guys are still on that project?
You been working since our trip to NYC
Glad to see that Samir's trolling has weaken
This is a different project? Or just been trying to give it someone else to do?
Oh ruby god
Girl is the Omaid picture, didn't she work at Blippar?
Girl next to Omaid
No wonder she left Blippar & Omaid was pissed at me. I was chatting her up on one of Fridays, then I realised that she was like 17. Beer Goggles
Would explain it. 2bh I wasnt  too bothered that a thunderbird wasn't like me
Didnt like me sorry
Oh Ruby God
Happy Birthday sweet cheaks
What is the place? Ruby planet?
I cant believe Radu is back
Grab he is raping your ears than mine as I usually be the fucker stuck speaking with him at parties
I used sit next to him in the Holborn office. Feels like life time ago now
Sat next to him for 3/4 months
Maybe he did inspire the dockey revolution motion?
Vegan sandwiches too
Yeah memory lane. Likes the art direction for Medievil
Im amazed that Sony didnt milk it with Medievil 15: The fight against zombie ISIS
Airbird?
I think the problem is that investors don't know much about tech and they don't want to miss on the opportunity to have stake for the next possible Facebook
I think this is back firing as the return on investment isn't so strong or repeatable as it used to be as the everyone makes apps now.
Belong you get cash from the blue flies I don't care how
Just having dinner, then I'm off over
Where is this dirty martini place in London Bridge?
Going by the website it looks twatty
What works? 
you gone to Shadwell already? The Party that bad?
Wow you certainly give your bag special treatment. I hope you treat your ladies the same
Humpage bagage
Fancy going somewhere else soon? This place is dogshit
How long is it running you know? I defo to check out exhibs around London over Xmas.
Never get to get the chance these days
I left early. Its not my cup of tea, Im getting old I think
You had your work party yet?
What a response. What happened next? She throw it in the bin?
You probably should work parties, good opportunity to ROAR at them
That a book awesome. Seems so unreal, so louis theroux
That book is awesome sorry
Interesting to see someone try to clamp on false posts on FB 
Dont think it will work but at least its a start
Howdy, you wanna meet at Oslo at 6.45? Which next to Hackney Central to get some food. Then we can head in for film for 8.30ish (starts at 9pm). Or is that too early?
Oslo food has beem blessed by Vegan & pay their staff more
Bring COD with you. Its your destiny
You sure? You been reading those sponsored reviews again
I hope your Uncle is okay. Maybe he should punch some prople in the face might feel better
you coming tonight? Myself & Lion at meeting at Hackney Picturehouse at 6.45pm?
You should throw them some vegan carrots
Yeah sounds pretty good. Its better to go clubbing on NYD than NYE, less people. Anyone else up for this?
I initally read that as paintings made by mechas. They are cool paintings :) maybe you should try & become a  super being according to scott pirgram
Vs the world
Howdy! Anyone up for games bash over my place at 27th or 28th? Games, beer & robots
Poor Lion :(
That sucks
What about in the evening? After work?
Who will be at Seb's Party?
If I go fireworks, 2 Qs. 1 - If you are going with a date, would I have to behave myself? Could she deal with lion/donkey talk or freak her out? 2 - who else is going? Does your date have any friends? I dont want to be piggie in the middle whilst you're making out.
Happy Xmas everyone :)
I think it looks abit poo but I no doubt will go and see it anyway
You know random pointless fact, this thread has 28000 messages. Wowzer we talk a lot
Maybe he thinks you're a commie. Be careful, he might kill you in your sleep to protect capitalism.
Yeah same here, my dad has been moaning that buses in Hackney are filled with Blacks & Browns people. I guess he is 73
Yeah very true. The conversation has turned to Uber. That should be fined as they hire immigrates, never hire English people.
Im up for the game of bones
Howdy, anyone fancy to pop out for tomorrow night? Maybe go around my place afterwards for gameage depends if I sort out my DIY in my bathroom. #1stWorldProblems
For a beer I mean
Awesome about tomorrow. Fancy meeting at Olso 5ish? Then we can travel elsewhere like Dalston or Clapton. Good flexable point.
Samir oh dear you go to work? I didn't realise that you did that ;)
I missed the George Micheal boat.   I was more stirred up by David Bowie going.
Up for meeting fir 5ish at Olso?
WTF? No way?
I go for that. Hopefully he gets more popular & gets me some bone (For devs in the room - it's slang for sex)
Emotion bot speaks "Ruby speak can't be compiled as it lacks sensivities of Joy & humor which is apart of this human curtural season called Xmas"
Party bot speaks "Ruby you coming tonight to get your beer on in Hackney? Or are you still located in the land of Pymonth?"
You're Ruby god, you don't need money. Only followers!
Its quite bizarre. A exhibit filled with man made arcade machines, looks quite entertaining
What about 7pm tonight? What about 1ish tomorrow?
you coming tonight?
I could do 6, I won't wanna do a hardcore one especially NYE coming up. stop being a dork. Come out! It's be good for your inner Lion. You can play Titanfall 2 anytime. We are meeting at Olso located at Hackney Central but will most probably go somewhere else afterwards.
You didn't say that you will tired from a hard day of work, just said you going to be playing Titanfall 2 instead.
Yes indeed. This thread has developers in it.
All I'm trying to say as if it wasn't clear is that I would like to see Lion and spend some time with him.
And to declare I don't nor can't get raped at anytime. Only at Blippar.
lol did I sound serious?
I guess I would need to declare "Serious robot" or "Serious Mode" for that to happen :)
You're writting Ruby 19 without realising. I like it :) When should I expect Ruby on Wheels?
I think I'm also near the end of the COD now as I'm going back Earth now. I think flying are the best aspect of it as its basically next gen starfox. On the ground, its pretty much COD with a different context. Titanfall 2 is awesome. I haven't played guardians yet, may play it tonight if no one is up for the meeting for the Novelty Exhib thing. I'm going to design museum in a bit actually.
Chris you at the design museum?
Just got here, funny timing
I forget how posh & tory west London is. I feel like working class monkey
No chicken or Kebab shops what is going on. This isnt London!
Is that your way of compile the info provided? To a.) Related comment b.) Random comment c.) Start new conversation
Semaphore? What?
Just played "Inside" in 3 layers of sheets to swear out my man flu. It is amazing, highly recommended. GOTY. Im feeling better, dont think I can handle rave. But certainly getting there.
Glad we all had good ones :(
:)
Same here lots of chores today :( We should arrange a film or board game night this week. Been playing this card game I got called "Boss Monster" which is good fun.
Yeah I agree. I think 99% of hollywood films are made by the board rather a indivdual so you get set of disconnected ideas without singular defined direction rather sum of them like you say. Not sure how much say/input Ripley has these days
Especailly on a big franchse like Alien
I see what you mean. I wonder if this is why popular individual style directors (not sure what you call them but I'm sure you know what I mean) like Quentin, Nolan, Darren Aronofsky, David Fincher, etc stay away from these big franchises? For years, Quentin he wanted to do a James Bond film. No doubt he did a pitch like James bond becomes a crackhead and lives on streets and becomes a farmer dealing with his past demons and kills his father. Then board was like "James can't do that he has to be smooth & posh". The board just don't want to give up creative control like that or risk how people may see the franchise. In this case, with Ripley its hard to say but generally I think this happens alot in Hollywood.
The board just wants someone to do a job not have a voice. Shame really :(
Maybe he just loves shooting those same shots again and again. He can't think of anything else. It is werid that such mastermind would end up like that. You would of thought he would making progressive art films about Donkeys, just a misunderstood genius rather a hollywood monkey
Maybe he was just "lucky" wasn't never good :(
*French Accent* (Sorry Steph - french people are known to be artists) As an artist, you're surely want to change/push new ideas toward rather recycle the same stuff.
I think they are nice positive stereotypes. Better than english ones, bad teeth, racist, bad taste in food, get easily drunk and fight everyone. When I abroad I just pretend I'm not english.
You could argue that Stereotypes aren't good for anyone but that's another discussion for another day.
Fabric has reopened? I thought the tories closed it down
Mute movie sounds interesting. Netflix is slowly taking over, they have so much produced content
Next gen stuff
Is it a PC or mobile game?
On a different subject, anyone up for the film night Wednesday? Shall I host or someone else want to host?
What you working on? Ruby OS 19? Ruby Situlation - what will the world be like if created by Nicolas Rubage?
*Robot Voice* What project are you working on?
documentary may be abit highbrow with the current theme of awful good. Maybe something like "Troll 2" it's so bad its genius
Never watched a classic japanese Godzilla film
Watched all king kong films, they are great :)
Might be easier to buy one of Android TV boxes as it has all hardware/OS. Just to need install apps - 
I'm going to get a Android box like this at some point. My mate has one in terms of ease getting content/quality of content its crazy but very dorgey & flakely
tho
I love variables. Rules & logic of the system are interesting. Just dislike when people are stuck in the mud, they dont want adapt the rules for the better good for the future. Say "this is law" whereas I think nothing in stone, I think be like water & have a open mind.
Why destory? But change. Make Chris Bones into Chris Fones. Insteading of selfish boning (taking all of the women) who could some phoning.
I was planning to play some Witcher 3 over Xmas but no such luck. 1st world problems too many games to play & movies to watch
I have to say I defo get layed with that pix on Tinder
Maybe I make perfect sense but you're all T-1000s
I see your name everywhere
Why I being photo raped in this thread?
why there in June? Is there your motherland?
Fuck! Sounds like I need to leave the Blippar ship before it sinks
Anyone look at nintendo switch annocements today? I have to say Im pretty unwelmed
Zelda & Mario looks amazing but everything was bit of meh
Anyone up for going to Crystal Maze? £60 each tho but sounds awesome :)
Not sure if the crystals are rubies tho
1+
Probably never went through QA or no one checked on anything about this game leading to trailer being posted to begin with. As platform holder/publisher, its just content.
Anyone up for this instead of film club this Wednesday? 
Who you talking to?
Hugo is great
Sounds very Bioshock infinate - 30's Streampunk. Need to play it again at some point. Game world was amazing
Nice website. My feedback is: 1.) is worth stating what tools/techinal skills you use? For people who dont know anything about motion graphics. Cause you may have clients who are clueless about MG & also dont know the value of what you add.  2.) How will clients find you? Have figured out using PPC/SEO? Is your website on other sites to get the traffic?  Or you expectating people to find via networking (business card)? Thats my 5 pence not sure if that is helpful or not
Yeah conceptual high brow for something so trashy
Very funny read
Im digging Orhre - good share
I hear that name somewhere from before I wonder if he is become Warp records
He has pretty unsual cover art too
What with the photo rape?
Anyone up for film club tomorrow 7pm around my place?
Fair say. If you wanna watch Godzilla, do you mind bring it on a USB Stick? My smart TV supports all formats. Next 1st world problem setting up sound bar through TV instead of PS4
I knew it you loved Ruby
We should start own boxwar
Wow!
Its a date
Either need to create onw box wars event or go to one in the UK as I think it's mainly USA ting
I think you should create cardboard ruby armour
I dont know you are quite popular & socialable Ruby & Lion
Get at least 100 Ruby & Lion fans
Anyone wanna go see T2 next weekend?
Yeah its on the list to buy/play. Many too games :)
Playdead probably needed to show something to get attention from recent story of co-formers leaving the studio & one of receiving huge payoff
No more photo rape please
My face is sore from all this rape
Hows the edcation thing going?
Kids digging it?
You skooling them in the way of Ruby?
Dev Bone
Sorry if I wasnt too talkive & active last night, the weed makes me zone out
Louis is one of my heroes
I liked Ben personally, real gamer geek. I think he was depressed tho.
Blippar didnt treat him well but he didnt help himself with situcation either. Remember when he started he was located in kicthen as there was no desks left
I never worked with him so I only spoke to him at the pub. Just watching "girl with all of gifts" its pretty good
You think the new app is a improvement?
I cant tell
Fair enough, just seems like mess really. Hopefully the new lenses becoming up it will become interesting like UGC
More focus
Anyone up for meeting tomorrow late afternoon? Thinking either games around my place or to see LaLa Land (its getting really good reviews)
We could do it over the hackathon. What time should I get there for? What is the theme?
Yeah maybe depends if the group wants to see it or not. For me, just nice to get out of house & hang out rather an actual film. Maybe Im getting old
You should come to be inspired to create Ruby on wheels. Ruby AI that creates wheels to run from you it's creator
Whats the address for the hackhon?
Do you know the postcode? Is that Old Street area?
*Hipster accent* We are in post modern age, repacking old ideas into new ideas to end the of captialism yaha"
Thats why you're Ruby god
Computer in He-man speaks like you & likes "Stone"
He-man really entertaing in old skool
Pure Comedy
Actually its my lunch break
WFH
He man is inspiring
Indeed
& the computer
I cant believe he called her "Boob"
You wouldnt say in todays cartoons
He man is art
Im meeting Simon Chang tomorrow
Where you meeting Sodeau?
Strong - Chang is your favouirate isnt he?
OK Im WFH so I can walk. What time you think you get there?
Where you meeting Sodeau tomorrow?
Come where exactly? The Mudcrap?
you love some Lion. FB knows you
Simon Chang isnt willing to go London Bridge to Thamaside, any option to go to Holborn as a middle ground? If not, I just met him at Wax's
Old skool problem solving, pretty progessive for its time
Strong Up for going to city of York pub (16th century style) in Holborn? Simon Chang is coming
Tonight
Citee of York pub
You guys going to come?
Its your destiny, you will meet lady Ruby here
My dad doesnt know Ruby
The force awakes - A new Jedi - For the power of greyskull
The force awakes - A new Jedi - to have a wank
The force awakes - A new Jedi - To become a vegan
Booked our NYC flights from Thurs 13 & coming back Monday 21 of April. If anyone wants to join
Got cheap flights £350 round trip
Me & Samir are going
You are making Ruby on wheels for some cash
?
Looks like he just cummed one with power of my voice
I wish that work on the ladies
1st world problems trying to decide which film to watch at cinema today. Which one would you watch? Hacksaw Ridge, La La Land, Manchester by the sea or Trainspotting 2. Too much films rrrrrrw
You wanna go to see T2 tomorrow?
Could go for 5.50pm showing sunday
you up for that?
Hackney picturehouse
Or 8.30 showing but is that too late?
Could do food before & head in for film 8.30
I hear it's going to be remake of the orignal. He isnt making it someone else is.
He is working avatar 2 & 3
Ok no worries we leave the film for another day
Keep it Ruby
Just watched "Manchester by the sea", really good. Highly recommend it. The film where I actually felt something.
You guys should go to Japan
Been so funny
Oh Ruby! Can you help with money if you need some or you need to come up with alternative revenue stream like Ruby code or something?
What happened to Patrick? He looked fucked today
Looked like he was raped
Poor guy! Is he alright?
I was going to give him a hug but I thought he may compile it wrong & see at a attempt for sexy times rather "I care".
I know the feeling regarding the faith. I think the app team will moved over to SF office at some point. I doubt QA will be moved over.
Anyone going to protest tonight? I've never been to protest before.
I wonder if UKIP will turn up and start bashing people
?
never been to one before?
I find it surprising that Pat isn't getting extension as I thought there will be lots of work on face rape feature
thursday sounds good for me for T2
I guess he misses his comrades
I'm sure if I was apart of a broforce, I would miss it too
I would argue this group is Rubyforce. Muslin Ban or Lion Ban? No lions allow to enter the US of A
Or Geekforce
Quite pretty album
Could be a good way to promote Ruby on wheels.
Get millions over night
But what actually is Ruby on wheels? A lanuage? & the interface like Xcode would be Rubage
I didnt think it would catch on like Donkey concept
Or is there more market for a new OS for mobiles? Although there is far more dependries for business creating OS as you need an app store. Developers to support your store. A lanuage is easier from business/user base convention point of view
Techinically creating lanuage is more difficult as you have create new libraries from scarth
Maybe it shouldn't be profident lanuage for any solution. Just a troll lanuage, if you can code this you're a developer god. Use it for the challenge like HTML5 back when for games
Strong - You order a ticket for NYC yet?
We should arrange a night to look airbnb to book a flat for NYC. When you next free? Friday night?
Cause we are doing T2 on Thursday right? Pats drinks tomorrow night
I guess they have to as they surely running out of material from orignal trilogy
I hope the gameplay has too depth to it. I enjoyed it but i could of been better with content & gameplay
Samir oh dear - So funny. Who is this guy?
I will go for some Star Wars fun
Annoyingly I bought "Not a Hero" before & I couldn't get into it but I know alot of people really dig it
LBP3 could a good one
I won't moan getting a free ticket for anything
Yeah will be going tonight
Anyone at Thameside already? Where is the guest of honor?
Yah
Give me 10
Ruby God
Its Very good. One of the best scifi movies I've seen in a long time.
Yeah it was alright, not many people popped out but then 2b fair not many people know the Pat West. Maybe his name puts people off
or being american
Anyone up for T2 2night?
You see donkeys are the future
I need to go there in the summer. Cornwall is your motherland ain't?
No donkey revolution
Nah not in the end. Ruby is busy making Ruby on wheels
Yeah I up for a trip to Donkeyworld
I need to drive to get there right? I need to learn to drive
where on the hackney PH can you get free fire tickets? I cant find it
How did you find that page on Phil? That is scary
Looks really young. Must of be like 20 years ago
I mean where you find the newspaper?
Blippar has raped & aged him good
So he is only 43. No way I thought he was at least 63
I be up for "unknown". Its a while off in June. Sounds interesting
I only have beef with Trump if he starting banning vegans & donkeys
What time are people are going to JC's party? I live near Stratford if anyone wants to come over for the pre-party. want to come to JC's?
Ok, I hope you're working on Rubycon website or Ruby on wheels framework :P
Instead
Looking at the weather for Barcelona currently its 14 which is pretty warm for winter. It should good :) Looking forward to it
Are you going to JC's tonight?
I cant keep up with the latest twists or turns of who is going or not to Barca. you know?
Is Tara coming?
Is she staying at our place or somewhere else?
With Vincent too?
How many beds does our flat have?
Yeah we may want to check
I'm become a spy or messager for the Ruby god
you coming tonight?
Nah go crazy
Whats the address for JC's place?
Oh Ruby God
Hows the Ruby on wheels coming?
Cant run it this device, check on pc in a bit. Sounds awesome
This device as my android is like 4 years old, its amazing it is still running
Wow you did all this one night?
You love Ruby
Could it be cool if Bot was like skynet destroying the world. You are trying to talk it out doing things. You would see video footage of the events like "Fridge going too cold to freezeing all food". You have reason with it in this case stop controlling temp of all fridges.
Its logic would be highly frozen food would longer & people would eat less
But 10% of the world would die as cant figure out to defrozen their food
Ruby mud?
Oh OK I thought they were called rogue games
Thats something else
I see
Maybe each player would have a different gameplay/scenario (mini game) but all link together in the context of story (stage of the story). One player would be helping people with their fridges (text adventure), one player would be figuring out/making many fridges (puzzle game) which cant be affected by the Ruby bot. One player figuring out to these new fridges to people without Rubybot knowing (stragey game)
Sorry Im getting excited
lol yeah :P
I think Icon need to a ruby on some wheels.
With wheels spinning
That is amazing
Although it needs to understand our words
those words
vegan
Donkey
Variable
That is very cool!
How did you do ascii effect?
Is a level you render ascii? As it does look like a level or objects in a 3D space at least
I see :)
We should go to this 
Ive never seen "The Room"
Isnt it like the worse greatest film ever? Or is just pure 24 carrot crap?
RippAR - rips your soul & eyes out with orange
You want it to be software development The Game?
Could have waterfall level
Or agile level
Split?
Anyone want to see T2 this Wednesday & John Wick 2 next week?
Year of the donkey wasn't?
Could do tonight although I am sleepy or tuesday?
Donkeyspotting would be good enough for my sleepy state
Tuesday?
Yeah the village was masterpiece compared to some of his recent stinkers
Also Signs is piece of art
comparing against the last airbreaker
Let's do some voting poll - Good old fashion way. 
Wednesday - Vote one
Vote for what day you want to go?
Vote from Ruby god is: Wednesday - 2 Votes Thursday - 1 Vote
Harlow is posh compared to Croydon mate. The place with most public teabagging in the world
Is this guy speaking bollocks?
Lots of buzzwords it seems
He seemed like what he was talking was quite personal to me & helped him cope which makes it worse & more awkward
It was like his idealogy he lived by
I thought he was going to cry
Sorry i meant quite personal to him, not me
Tomorrow
Rubage club on Thursday
For the next steps for Ruby on wheels project
One small step for variables & one huge leap for OSes
Yup im up for that
T2
Ton8gh
Tonight
T2 Thursday? I was going to book ticket for tonight
Whats too late?
I guess you guys want to Benard leaving drinks on Thursday. I just want to see T2
Never going to see it at this rate
I'm up for tonight
You want to go Samir & Ruby
I've booked a ticket tonight
Seat E10
Hackney picturehouse
9pm
It's just the two of us, man date x x x
lol
You want to meet for food earlier? Or you coming only for the film after a drink Ryan?
Schmaltz is leaving Blippar too or leaving the UK?
He just spensered the whole company in one email
we just got spensered in one email the whole company wowzer
He is dumb
Misunderstand. Your variables aren't declared correctly. Human speak - What?
Im getting old. I've only hear of 5% of the line up but festivials are always good regardless of the music. I'm up for it. What Bestivial like? Is there lots of random stuff to do or is it more of a music festivial? Last festivial I went to was Green man. 50/50 of music & random fun stuff
Or maybe you're just scenester twat.
Mcfly
Green Day
They still around?
They formed some pop metal super group like "hellstar" or something, they were terriable too
My biggest guilt pleasures seeing live were Andrew WK & SlitKnot. They both really entertaining
You should add slide about Donkeys
One can only work if accept all type of animals
You cant just have horses
You need Donkeys to do the hard day to day work
Where is this place?
Just see lots of twatty tourists
Is it near Tanner Street?
Anyone for this tomorrow night?
Ruby god. I shall not do that anymorw
anymore
We should do Ruby Tuesday
Pan the idea out
Sorry I was visiting old friend I didnt see your IM till now 
You're in hipster land arent ya?
I prefered the tone of the story for GTA 4 than 5 too. It was revenge story but the problem with GTA stories they always lose their pace with side character missions which are nothing with main story arc & you have no context why you need to do them.
Its bad TV show wherethey  develop side character/plots arcs that go nowhere
No thanks I had enough of DJ butter & MC peanut butter in the 90's
DJ burn & MC fire
?
Probably does exist
:P
Depends on how you view the music/what you want from your music. When I was in my teens in Croydon, I knew alot of kids that were MCs or in punk bands, they were in it for the fun of it, I was too. If they got to play some gigs in Croydon & made some quid that's all they wanted. Other end of spectrum, I met kids who used play music 10 hours per day & quite take seriously like a art.
It's like compairing Radiohead to So Solid Crew
Radiohead clearly take themselves very seriously and want to produce art
Wheeras I don't think So Solid Crew care about that, they are just happy to be producing music (Which I don't think they do).
Maybe an bad example but you get my point. If I called myself "DJ Ruby & MC Jonesy fucker" It's clear that I'm not taking myself seriously & wanting to produce something high brow
Are like what? Sorry. They don't take themselves seriously?
If I have to explain a joke, its not very good one.
Maybe the next time we are at the Pub, I was logically explain it
That's what animal planet is about, pure randomness!
On reflection I thought pretty good. I wasnt too hot on it at first as I thought it was abit emo & close to home but that was point. Just sad people that havent moved on stuck in a timewarp which I can relate to. I feel like dinosaur at times.
It was very different film
I really like Boards of Canada. Although they are wanky
That is pretty next gen ass eating
I was disappointed that NASA didn't discover a planet filled with donkeys or lions
If so my space program worked
Narita Boy looks amazing. Although I wonder how much freedom/control you have when it's so heavyly animated? Typically the more animations you have, less control you have with movement like Assassin Creed or gears of war
Just kickstarted Narita Boy! Exciting times
It's so weridly disillusioned
He is sorry
I remember watching Mario bros
Interesting watch about the making of, makes sense why it is so bad
In NJ state you need a gun license to fire a weapon. Never fired a gun
One of those tick off the list things
I'm up film tomorrow. Samir & Ruby let's do NYC stuff at 5ish tomorrow if you're free? Then Samir & myself can head 6ish, get to angel about 6.30ish.
cool, I hear it's a GG
I love rape
Isn't northern line fucked today? I have  alook
Looks like fun, forward for some Kong action. Lion, Samir & myself went to see John Wick 2 last night, it was great. Certainly worth a watch.
Non-wank pure nonsense slick action
you loser child! You need to play a Zelda!
How is MV Ruby?
Went to Dalston & went to random bar meeting lots of frenchies. Then tried to in the Nest. It was random innocent one
Samir met his love
I might to be Samir wingman tonight to the love age
These are main highlights, I can't assed to in the details
Also send lion many love messages & he didn't come out to party.
:P
Didn't you send messages to Lion to?
Oh ruby god
To show how creative MV office is
Just got up, what a night
Yeah lol
We are all waiting outside for the police to sort it out
MV guys are missing out
I'm up the Ripley talk, if you have a spare ticket
Done that, got T-SHIRT mate.
I use to maintain game design blog, no one read it tho
It's really shit - 
I miss game design but there's no money in it :(
Oh wow I would of thought no man sky would very hardcore following
It's think it would be that niche
I haven't actually played it yet but just looks boring. Great tech demo but nothing engaging about it
There is no feedback/reward loop. New stuff looks cool but yet again why would I do any of this? Still no game there
I thought if it have level up system or random mission generator like mmo
Collect 50 donkeys
& receive 50 xp
Send donkeys to space
I using Google pixel at the Mon & the OS keeps showing me shop & location info to eveywhere I go. Right now, showing local co-op info closing at 10.30pm
Scary times
Info is so accurate & related to my position
Could be first console to support your ruby on wheels framework
Ruby
Blood orange juice doesn't sound as nice
We wank more than we build
Typical
That is something you do Samir maybe you use your trolling for good
That's your power: trolling the scammers
Ruby god to the stage. You really are becoming a god
I know it's last minute, anyone fancy going to see Kong: skull island, tonight at 8.20pm Hackney picture house. Could meet before hand for food/drink? Need to get out of the house, been in the house 4 whole weekend wanking over Zelda.
Yeah film night sounds like a plan, Zelda is awesome. Can't stop playing it, how many shires have you found so far?
People like him just take advantage & need to shot in the face
Tory test face
Twat
Face
What is a challenger brand?
Looks super pants like super Alien rip off
Yeah none of the actors seem to fit
I'm going to get killed by a glove
Thayga looks pissed off, what you do to him?
Anyone for film club tonight?
You told it's a thing :P
Bummer that I've been beaten to the punch but great minds think alike
I never said that sweet cheeks, it's the concept.
Your job Ruby as you're a god. Anything you say goes & logical correct
Man I'm old I'm 12,000 days old
No wonder I'm so wise
Just a mean amount
12,000 & something
MP 3 was so underrated
Perfect action weekend game
I liked how each level felt different because of the context although it is same gameplay patterns
Very dump but smart game
Closest thing to "Taxi driver" the game, sad guy making the best of fucked up situcation
Blippar Rippar
Did you read the email he send out today?
Just cover his BS
Oh please
I don't care about your media drama, just run your company properly
The sad reality that the end result (the film) will probably end up being pants. Just aligning my own expectations.
Green Giant - I hate to break to you but there's quite a few Chris Joneses. Not the only one, I've met a few they are evil
Beat you with carrots
Matt I see! Other Chris Joneses are evil, one of many evil twins. He was probably Chris Stabo
Not Chris Bones
Chris Cones
Nor
Rish was telling us about this crying
It was abit emo but Samir cheered him up
He was abit emo
What did you say?
"Oh dear, you been trolled, I can troll you if you like"
Then run off with bottle of wine
How is your family friend? Gave her slab yet?
You didn't miss much
Tell him about Ruby on Wheels
Maybe that could work. Or you say "Stop worrying about twaty jouros & focus on what matters. Use your Rish powers"
Or you could say "I'm Ruby godwith 5 followers, I'm better than you"
Myself, Samir, Pat West, Lion & Joy Green Giant
Got deadicated fan base
Because of your 5 deadicated fans?
I hate to break to you I find the hype behind thing more important than actual thing. So in this case, Ruby on Wheels doesn't matter what it is, it's idealogy & values of the thing
Actually wished I had some diplomacy lessons from Danny, I'm upsetting quite a few people at work
Tim actually
It's complicated to explain on here but I've sandwiched between him & SF office
Tim is very good, only PM I've worked at Blippar who actually knows what he doing. Not just fancy talker but just the politics
How werid is that
Rish doesn't understand software development - a PM doesn't know enough about design to informed professional opinion
Yeah indeedo. PM are usually Devs or designers who aren't good enough to do that so become a PM instead, force opinion on that disclipine which weren't good enough to begin with
Yeah exactly
Melody was the same. Going in about UI/UX
Mule?
Drug or fuck mule?
I'm amazed she is still functional as a human
Not a mule
I think she is your opposite. Opposites attract you know
West - East
Posh - Pikey
Twatty - friendly
I'm sure you get what I'm trying to say
Glad you made a laugh. Chris Stabo is a possible evil twin
I don't think it's actually a word I afraid but If I was give a meaning it would "Someone is abit Staby, like stabbing people" Abit south London
Yeah indeed. I can add urban dictionary & make it official word on the street
I remember adding a word with Lion boy but I can't remember what it was. I think it was Sodeoed
Someone talking crap at you
can you remember?
I hoping the Gifs would inspire a response from "The Lion Boy" himself
Maybe I should post some more?
Is that a Mexican donkey?
I bought Oxenfree on PS 4 while ago, it's on my list to play
Yeah interesting stuff
Good experment
How do you have the video?
Whatever video you created for the face thing
Ruby Giant productions
Jolly northern giant productions then
Do you have the film?
Oh giant boy
I like the password of chrislovesham
& the random photo of yourself in there
Actually could send me that pix. I wanna use on Tinder, I might get Onion with that pix
I think the title reflects our reality within this group, always seem amazed by what I say for some reason
We need that device back, could I could fired over that shit. They are looking for any reason chop QA to you giving to them
Nah from London
He is God after all but needs to think about consequences of his actions
I thought you love Clem
Visiting my family today, mother's day bollocks
Sorry
lady
Shows that Chaos Theory works
Erm?
Water drop scene?
Oh yes I know what you mean now. Heeeheee when you put it that way, it makes sound quite lame. In fact, there is alot of variables you haven't considered, timing, context, volume of other channels  that the Lion could posted on. He choose to post on FB messager, on right time, which happens in that context of the conversation. You couldn't predict that
Also you could consider other factors like intent or the mood/state of being of "the lion" if it was sad mood he wouldn't posted it.
The dog has more likes than I do. Popular dog.
I think it's chaos theory in a vacuum, small things can make such difference. I want to become a wrestler now, truly inspired by that video.
green giant - nah you're just the player, not the game.
The Raid films are awesome which make western action films seem retarded & lame on comparison
Talking about becoming a wrestler. I think I would do a character like "Rad Man" or "MTV man" & complaint that kids don't know MTV & better than Snapchat, every match would go in with TV.
Or go as "Donkey man" or "Bird man". "Didn't fuck with a donkey, I'm the spokesman for donkeys & they hate your shit" Then bring up a donkey to fuck other wrestler up.
Certainly very entertaining, not much sportmanship
Poured my heart & soul into that & no response.
Mannuel couldn't cope with all this ham & cheese talk
He leave with style tho
Left sorry
Face rape
I liked him personally. Shame he hasn't stayed in touch
Or just needed a power wank
Yeah maybe whilst being wrestler part time throwing TVs at people
I say "have you tried wanking with two hands?"
That's sounds like a awesome wrestler
I fight him with my ham made cape
Sounds wonderful, I think I declare myself as depressed
Yeah maybe. Although from my experience of being emo, you do something extreme get out of it. Highen emotion & energy
Although programme isn't very repeatable.
Hehheeee I laughed out loud then
Can't watch it either no permissions to watch EU
Sounds like a film that needs to be made
Rish & Omar space programme I mean
Also none of menuflows actually work
How you access my account? Actually Wagner's
Oh yes they share pics between testflight account
Face Profile has been shit storm when the beginning, it's hard to recover from that but it is getting better. Like I was saying to Ruby God, I think it's not about the feature as 1.) It's not for us, we are not 16 2.) I think  its good for team building working all teams of whole company.
He is such design idiot
Who is Jamie?
Other thing is the politics of face as it's so clear they want to be SF creation so lens are purely SF thing. So no one in London will have a say
Oh really? Interesting. My previous experience working with MV that filled with dicks
Like clem
I only work with App team, they are great.
I don't interact with BD or marketing anymore
Phil is annoying, the rest are great
SF office probably very different
I think it doesn't help that every 6 months, there's a super cut with 10 people getting fired
Senior management has fucked with London office too much
The problem is the communication as I keep getting those questions too
Confluence doc or something
Does not like him either?
Looks pretty scary actually I thought be funny like "Life".
I haven't watched the original IT in years, I remember it being quite overdrawn & scary
It was 3 hours long & had some intense scenes built up & up getting worse as it went along
I guess typical horror story structure begins innocently then gets more werid as it goes on
It thought I'm getting more normal in  my old age
What I can I say Ruby I'm a complex human being
I recommend being a wrestler smashing TVs on other competitor
Does spencer not like Santhosh?
Why?
Do you not say his name every 5 mins?
WTF?
I hear SF office has closed down everyone is going get moved to SF
MV sorry
Oh Ruby god
Yeah they only showing special edition version featuring donkeys on Wednesday. Hollywood cut the scenes out as they thought people weren't ready/just too progressive
What's your seat numbers? You are going Thursday 21.10 showing yeah?
Ok for booking tickets, thanks :) Shall I buy you burger in return (whatever £ value is)? You want to come with your dad? Mannuel isn't on this channel anymore (Not enough pasta talk I guess). Anyone want IM him? as I know he wanted to go too
41 billion to Google is probably pocket change to them, if it's a joke or not. Google is the internet other than FB
Everything about RippAR is questionable whereas Google's wealth & who they can buy isnt. They can pretty much buy anyone they want & afford it
I wish phones were called stuff like that instead of Samsung S7 so functional & boring
Samsung Banana Phone
The i-ghost
Sounds like my evil twin. Why make Vin Diesel face? At least make face of a Ruby god
God - Did you do that? Did you Google that image?
Although Chris Jones isnt in the team or has anything has anything related or to do with the team. I like you logic
Your logic
Lolol it makes me laugh
I guess a Miss Jones (female) did or could produce a Chris Jones. So it makes sense in declaring parent of the child type of way
How is that possible? BS news if you ask me
thanks for the link, sounds really cool. or anyone else fancy going to this Saturday?
Tell him that there is a gym there :P
there are other ¦ & lots of vegan burgers there.
there is lots of people you can troll there
& make them into memes
The good old days
Variables
Samir, Ruby & giant you love it. It's variable heaven
Can't remember what? Sorry
Ham for Life
But this ham is vintage
You have Sodeau's number, why don't you ask him?
Steve needs a new UX person probably as he didn't like Manuel the French guy. He actually made some sense & knew what he was doing
Manuel is gone. He was a contractor
You should welcome back to your videos
Showing him all those pics you have
I wonder what he think of your Gifs on slack
You could say that you created them for just his return although see a history of sodeaus across slack for the past 2 years. What makes me laugh that is no one knows who he is anymore
He has more famous through Gifs than it was when he worked at Blippar
Samir oh dear get on it
Fibreglass 2?
I can't remember talking about "Fibreglass 2"? Ruby god
I look forward to seeing on Thursday
Seeing you
I think he think all us Europeans are nuts
Thyaga I men
mean
Yeah i used to rock at competitive mp games as you get older, you don't enjoy the stress & hard work of playing the same maps over & over to get good. I was at my best with halo 2 but I remember I use to play at least 4 hours each day. On Saturday, I would start playing 2pm & finish 2am. They are more casual options like Uncharted or Titanfall 2 which you can get some kills & enjoy it without dedicating your life to it but usually still get your ass kicked by a teenager
I really enjoyed KZ2 too. It's so well designed, it was one of 1st games using alot of scaleform so the Hub elements were in game/contextual in the environment like enemy/foe initators were their uniform with red & blue. Number of bullets in your clip was actually on your gun.
Game & visual design was very interesting for KZ2 it did alot of cool  things despite the generic theme of space nazis

Natalie Postman is hot too, then & now. It was OK to have hots for her then as I was probably the same age.
That knife video was filmed in Stoke Newington
I recognise the shop on the street
Small world
Lol What can I say? You can't take out south London out of me despite the switch. A old saying in south, "get rich, make the switch".
Actually that would be my evil twin right?
Maybe it made switch too
Made the switch I mean
What's the summary from today's meeting? We all fired yet?
That kebab guy rocks
RippAR
Sorry to hear that about your role, that sucks :(
We have many ideas myself & Ruby God
Yeah indeedo. You will need your walking boots on & prepare to be aggressive especially in midtown as people don't mess about. I have to say travel by foot in NYC is alot smoother than London.
I personally preferred the subway in NYC than London, once you get your head around it. it's so much quicker and nicer experience
Where is Rish? I want to fart in his face
You need to get used to another logic. if you used every day for 10 days, you would have no problems. Like learning Ruby from JS. I agree that the design of the map isn't great but the actual service & experience of the subway was so much better. It was never super crowded, it was fast. I never had to spend 20 mins to find the right platform.
Fuck the internet, it's filled with twats
On the topic of transport, London is miles behind most major cities. Then again it's one of oldest.
Compared to Berlin or Tokyo, it's embarrassing. You could to go from west to east in 10 mins whereas here it will take  70 mins if you're lucky
Yeah sure, that's not saying much as UK transport as a whole is pretty poor a
Man I'm going to end up such hipster buying all these vinyls without a vinyl player
Just use them as wall art
All I need now is a dog & some plants. I'm 99 percent hipster (I can't be vegan to reach 100 percent)
Nicolas Rubage Story would be interesting. The developer creating his own system to escape from system that created him. Could be a good movie
I have a beard, skinny jeans (I'm not exactly skinny anymore), plenty of cardigans and knitted hats
We have only touched the surface, we never went deep in
Is this DJ Butter & MC bread again?
Bon Jovi who is he?
I hear of king lizard and the gizzard wizard
or the fuck buttons
or holy fuck
Declaration 
Topic: Music artists
Type of data: Array/list of artists 
Purpose: Humor 
Context: Taking piss of out of the fact that we have all different experiences/tastes in music and me being a hipster like werid music.
Can you compile this input?
My face is getting raped again
There is alot of talk but not much action. There is no point talking about it as the concept vs implementation vs reality, are 3 very different things. Which is what Steve and Rish don't understand
From a high level, I think Blippar survival will be focusing on B2B which is what they are good at whereas B2C is very hard to get right & expensive. Basically Blippar will become AR tools/engine provider like Unity
It's going to be interesting to see the difference from Blippar vs FB and Snapchat for tools that other businesses can use.
From B2C point of view, Snapchat & FB will rape blippar
Very true but I think they are more focused on their key product/features and this AR thing is just experiment
Blippar has always lacked focus & direction
clear direction anyway
Checklist Of Dullness more like
Seen this same crap on for very 1st COD 15 years ago
At least that be more original & inspired
I forgot what it was called but WW1 game really enjoyed it was made by Rayman guys (Ubisoft) but you had a dog in that who helped get the minefields. The dog was great
You're a god so you can invent your context
it's actually really good game & no it's not called "Mines Dog" incase you got confused
Well maybe I'm mastermind leading you all on your paths. If I told you the plan you freak out
War is fucked up
Why was Vietnamese war cool or other ones? Did they fight with chop sticks instead?
Looks like he being raped
Shame that it will be poo!
Get Out was very good
Did you watch GITS in the end? What did you think of it?
Like Star Wars, just leave it alone. After 1st 3 films, its just cash cow then. After that point, you're run out of anything new to say underless the franchise is really diverse & huge like star trek for an example
Any franchise in general
I can't think of many franchises which keep high quality/experience after 1st 3 films. Same for games too actually
I agree. The common problem with this approach is balance between creative control vs boundaries/understanding what makes franschie works or logic of it for a director explore new ideas in that universe. For an example, you wouldn't want to watch a film about Farmers & Vegans in Star Wars universe whereas story about Gangsters (jagga the hut the movie) with cyper punk theme could be cool.
When you see films like Batman vs Superman, you can understand why film producers want to keep control/stick to what works/format. I wonder to solve this problem, franchise creators need to brief directors on rules of the universe so he/she can explore it but stick to what makes to work. I think Matrix did this well with animatix
Yeah indeedo
Which I don't think many people in hollywood gets. Wachowski brothers (or sisters) were pretty ahead for their time
although the sequals & games were abit crappy but I digged the ambition
I've only seen Matrix and Bound, they did speed racer right?
Sense 8 is pretty good
I recommend to show it to any bigots as it has awesome powerful minorites
Although it feels like checklist of stereotypes but at least there is content explore these minorites. It's baby steps
Blood Drive looks next gen
Where are you today Ruby god?
wanking from home more like :P
I better not wank at work, I been done for many sex crimes
Latest RippAR gossip they fired 3 Devs & 1 PM (Maurice) in SF office
today
So basically they dropping Blipp Builder as they were core people on that project
I thought I was first to hear about this for once
Gossip firsts
Yeah I'm actually very tempted to just ResignAR myself 2bh
Yeah the reality is that they won't fire me because I deliver & do what I'm told but my days are numbered due to politics
I used to do level design but there is no money in it
you're been alright! Use your frog powers
I liked Catman
Nice ones never get on do they?
It's all about Half Life & UT mate, the level editors were awesome
Oh Ruby person
What is the plan for tonight?
Belong its not Mudfart or Thameswank, I go
I guess Rish has to. His role is blow the trumpet and sell the company, making out how great it is
CEO job
Yeah that's the job
smarter people will always have what? Sorry Its Friday
I know what you're saying but that is just nature of his role, all CEOs are bullshit merchants. Their job is sell to vision of their company whatever how bad/illogical it may be. Like Apple do it all the time.
Anyway RippAR stuff is boring, anyone got any plans over the weekend?
I used to live in CP, nice area. Its far out there near croydon
Its type of thing that would be CP as it is very middle class hippy area
Hippy in the best possible way
I remember going there while back with my ex, they had green party community events to keep your homes green
its filled with Vegans
Ruby if you want some, the women will love you there.
I thought he was Bin Laden
As a Ruby God, could you explain this to me? He is a showman & Pure BSer with the lack of people skills & kill people (fire them without feeling) for his own agenda. Is there any difference?
Maybe that was too far. I love pushing boundaries. Anyway anyone up seeing Guardians 2 tonight 9pm showing at Hackney picture house?
I really did go too far. Blanked
You could try Richer Sounds but usually sell top end TVs
So you know that TV will be solid, they never sell crap.
Why am I getting photo raped again?
Yeah similar systems are used most 3rd person games these days which used grids to determine the animation but its very cool that it is cloud based processing & deternime the path on the fly
I remember watching tech demo for Assassion Creed I was amazed by animation system. That was years ago. Cool to see how it has evolved since
Samir told me that you're doing something with him on Satursday
In London
Going to some coding conference or something
This week for sure
Because I'm going as well
This conference looks pretty awesome
Trust me, you won't want to miss it
It's a very special event and I got ticket for Sam too
It was going to be suprise
Sam and Ruby you won't regret it
Its very special & secret
Both
You wait and see Ruby.
If told you that would ruin the fun
Also I thought you developers never went out anyway
So it will be insanely good won't it
I wanted to use rubicon as its title but the community got upset as it wasnt logically or complieable so I had to change to use CamelCase - RubyCon
Sorry I having important calls & arrangments for RubyCon. Community wants to change Ruby Doner
Like Ruby Kebab
Making the event so much assessable for non devs
I will coming giant boy
I will be coming
Anyone up for watching Guardians 2 tomorrow for 9pm showing picturehouse?
No one on here actually in the UK currently who wants to come, so I will wait for next week or whatever
What deadlines? There is actually deadlines for Face. The never ending project which should died months ago
Vegans are downers but I think you should date one or al least sleep with one you enjoy it
On more boring note: my friend of mine was telling me that you can ask voluntary redundancy
If Blippar needs to let me more people but just volunteering is the option
Good point, the company would really become the Titanic, sink quick.
3 tickets for £25
You will get some bone there
Oh ruby twat
I was going to say that the word "bit" wasn't excessive enough to stress the steer drop of demotion but I guess twats do make feel like a god
Yeah no thanks. No donkeys & no vegans
Im talking about blade runner movie, going by the trailer there wasnt any donkeys or vegans so I think the film will be poo
There is need for strong females roles getting better representative in media so why not vegans or donkeys?
He certainly a noble steed
Yup. Interesting questions coming from a lion. Are you figuring out if you should eat one or not?
Who going to that club tomorrow night? There is invite on FB
Working?
Anyone up for fun fair tonight? Its down the road where I live could go before going out. Abit of tacky fun is good for the heart
may inspire better declaraion of vartiables & contasts
That situcation was your setup of partlcuar planing & placement
I thought his store in trump tower was awesome
Looks pretty cool Chris. When you going?
that is +1 for Sam Strong
At this rate, it looks like it will be just the two of us. Man Date x x x
Sorry You talking about seeing the Alien film or Pink Floyd exhibition?
Regarding Pink Floyd exhib, wanna go Satursday? By Friday Im usually abit dump & tired to take in any useful new information
Exciting, what is your new job?
How exciting :) Product management is a good path & interesting
Do you need to know lots about business? Been thinking about it for my career change but thinking about heading towards development (coding) rather management
Yeah fair enough, good to know :)
In regards of Bday partying, I'm free Friday & Saturday nights. What you want to do?
There is one in Whitechapel which is very fun but probably need a big group to come
It really cheesy and crappy in best possible way
Wowzers
Good animation is so hard, its a real skill
Any good animator is like a god, so there is so few that can do it
Even more special & rarer than being a Ruby god 
I think there is movie trailer in there somewhere. Jeremy Corbyn: The Movie, "he is fighting posh fox hunting fuckers & bringing justice back to the system"
So no one up for Alien or Frog's drinks?
Looks like it will be man date for Alien 
Yeah im free any night. So tomorrow is good. want to come?
I want to give you 5D experience
What? Cube me? Tesseract - dont even know what that means
Not sure how I feel about that. If I was apart of everyone I would never feel lonely & always with sense of belonging/loved but you would be average joe, nothing special. If I'm the only "Chris Jones" as single entity, Im unique with possibility of being remarkable & special but alone. Like socialism VS individualism. This is getting deep
Alien showings are 6.30 or 9.10pm
Tomorrow
Yeah im up for 9.10pm
Lets meet before the film for 7.30ish at the venue
Get some food & drinks
Samir oh dear has woken
I cant do a crazy one with 50 pints tho, as I have a interview on Wednesday
Yeah maybe plan to party at the weekend. At company called Peak. They make brain trainning app, its pretty good compaired to RippAR
Yeah thanks :) Yeah wait & see, might not take it even its offered. Playing with the idea going to bootcamp course to get skooled up on web development in Berlin or Barcelona for a few months. Having options is a good, right? Just figuring out the best one
Ok Thanks for the tips. I will check them out for sure :). One of the reasons thinking to do bootcamp course is you are deadiating/forced a solid block of time to learning rather doing it when I have time. In summary after work Im not in the mindset/ or dont have the time to learn properly. Maybe I just need to make time.
Do 10 - 6pm. Get home early & do a few hours of JS a night
I see what you mean. I enjoy coding in JavaScript (didnt like Objective C - too old skool) but just the case of practicing & learning the logic, the why?  Does Code Acedemy explain/learn about the logic? Why you write in this way?
Probably could get away with it actuallt
Just booked seat G11 if you want to sit together for Alien
Oh Ruby god. What you doing instead? Boning or coding?
To me, this is God speak
Developer god
You are writting the Ruby on wheels bible?
Why not?
You created it, I don't know what it is. You're the God
You ready for the 5D experince?
No Ruby God, that is 4th dimersion. Going to act out face hugger actions on him to give the possible feeling that he is in the actual Alien film universe.
No
Samir you will get 5D experience too but no boning involved which Ruby imagined
That was accident, I was genuinely scared. It was fucked up film in very good way
I'm going to Silicon Milkroundabout on Sunday but I can't have any "Chris Jones" talk when I trying to look profesional and get a job
I hate to break to you but No that wasn't me
I can imagine talking to a employer at the career fair impressing them then you come along and say "He is Chris Jones, He thinks I'm a Ruby god" or you start yelling across the hall "Chris Jones" randomly
Pink floyd is at V&A & robot is at Science which are next door to each other so you could easily do both in one day
We are going to out during the day on Satursday. Do you do sunlight? Ruby Vampire
you coming?
What time you wanna meet on Satursday?
Its easier for me to meet ya there, only takes 35 mins for me to get there
1pm at south ken station?
Yeah I can meet at South Ken & you can fart on Samir & Ruby faces to ensure life from the night before
Really? I don't think I even saw you walking during the day in NYC
Yeah that is better than the film. What did you think of the film?
I thought it was watchable entertainment
Yeah pretty much with some science throw in
Is Robocon the evolution of Rubycon?
Yeah I'm for games & drinkage on Satursday
Man he sounds RAD
Dude you have a family of tards in a good way
WTF
Blippar is getting raped
Doing culture tomorrow, so I will have easy one tonight. But we are going out tomorrow night right? For the loading bar?
I'm doing Milky on Sunday
I never know what is best method to share your details in career fairs anymore, are CVs done thing?
Better to give out business cards
is probably better
Oh Rubyinator
What happened to that Audioslave super band? Were they still prodcuing music?
I remember getting their 1st album, find it a odd mix of rage and garden. It didn't quite work.
Tom was the Rage right?
I remember seeing them Live at Reading, RAGE were great Live
Was Zach raging about the comments? Or was he for them?
Just can't figure out they were genuinely trying to express their political views or just drama/fiction for sales as stories sell.
Do you honest think most artists they claim that they were gangsters/from the streets, really have been? Just great fiction to sell records. If you were genuinely from that world, I don't think you want to talk about it, let alone express to whole world.
I go for one or two but its going to be early one for me tonight
Oh Rubyinator
Yup i'm in meetings till 7pm :(
I'm hoping I can skip this next meeting
Sam Strong is here too
The Miller?
Just come to office as we are going to Shoreditch somewhere
That is best GIF Ive even seen
Ham & Cats what a combo
We at the book club
In shoreditch wankland
It was so random even I didnt predict that outcome
It was life instead of a movie
Will there be any vegans going?
Is Steve a vegan or anti-vegan? What side of the battle does he sit?
That explain why it says "Fuck you Motherfucker" aloy
alot
where you go tonight? I thought we were getting married tonight?
Are the burgers vegan?
Hi
Whetre did go? Dancing alike a twat for past 30 mins by myself
Making my way now, be there in 20. You sitting downstairs?
This is type of place I was talking £6 coffees
I cant afford to date vegans anymore
Im at Brick Lane doing career fair. Anyone fancy meeting up around here for a beer & some sun?
I been OK. I rather be out in the wild than visit your flat during a sunny day
I have to be honest, I didn't get anything you said Ruby
Looks & sounds really middle class but maybe I've got all wrong
Owen Jones thing I mean
"Ta Bub. I'm Danny Trier and Im about to meet some Brita tankers"
On my happy note, anyone up for movie night tomorrow? Not sure what exact time as yet as I'm having drinks with possible future co-workers but cant imagine them being hardcore party animals, starting at 4pm.
You dont want to come to Movie night? Could put on Ruby film, im sure there is many Ruby themed films we could watch (on the coding lanuage or actual real diamonds)
. You seem to avoiding the real question of movie night. But answer your Q: yeah it went well
Not sure yet but Im sure this topic unfolds further, we will figure that out
Its a small start up, so I guess they want to know if I fit in.
I only show my insanity to yourself as you are god that needs inspiration
Even then I'm holding back as it's a while to process such data
I be up for that :) Which show you want to go?
Talking about gigs, I was going to broken social scene tonight but the Manchester bombing I'm abit paranoid
I guess security measures will very tight because of this
because of Manchester I mean
Yeah we have all been there
Its bank holiday this weekend isn't? Yippeeee Anyone got any plans?
No that was for yesterday but Im up for it tonight. Figuring by the high demand & excitment for such a event, I doubt it will happen
Yeah up for a drink. Where should we go? A pub by a river?
There is pub near where I live by a river which is quite nice. Then again it's a trek for everyone else (long way to travel)
we been to that pub before
I finish at 6, what about you Stomg?
Sam Strong sorry
Ok sounds good
Be careful Ruby. You might be ISIS target in Manchester as you're a god afterall
ISIS wins with the downfall of western civilization by taking out Ruby Developer God. Sounds like hell of storyline for some tech sci-fi movie
Ok great
We have gone tower bridge for parkage
Can I invite some vegans & donkeys?
How's Japan?
Yeah Japan is very awesome, I have a few friends out there so I need visit again
Depends on what RippAR lot are doing tonight, I was suprisely fun last week. We just Invite Rob along
Will you guys do Dev battle? Ruby vs JS
Like a rap battle but with varible declaraion
Not sure this RippAR lot like grass, they are probably want some posh joint. i guess we could pitch it and see where it  goe  s
You & Rob of course
Probably more of logic battle
The sad reality is that people will follow as they are looking for someone to blame/justify the reason
People want convenient understandable stories rather complicated hard truth
I've never attempted a logic dev battle before, how it does work?
WHY IN CAPS? ARE YOU ANGRY?
I glad you get the irony of this going-on jokes/situcations
or gets my madness
I find funny that I gave you Noel Gallagher article, you didn't even blink
Either way, I thought you be delighted by the gesture
I was so dispointed that wasn't a real website
I think you guys miss my presents rather my work/output
NICOLAS RUBY
I really enjoyed Farcry 3 but over that, they are all same, just different textures & context.
Ubi soft sandbox games are starting to crack, they were ahead with Rockstar but everyone else has catched up/outdone them
Sandbox games is one of most competitive genres, so you have make shit hot game if you want to remembered
In the past 6 months, you had Zelda and Horizon, which are rated like best sandbox games ever with 5/6 years of development for each game.
Its pretty dead at RippAR HQ
Shall we plan alternative night out?
Joris told me that you're bringing your Ruby framework
Just eating some food. I will be there in a bit
RUBY
Or should I say "Nicholas Rubage of Mother Russia"
?
I was raised by Vegans in Spain.
Brainstorm is meant to be offensive to people with epilepsy or mental health problems
PC gone mad if you ask me
The Ruby Diaries
I wonder if it be like basketball Diaries?
Do you think Ruby be Leo & Tizzle be mark walberg?
That is so such anime character to say of course
I wonder if you could say you have a nest up my ass?
Techincally true
What are you refering to? Declarion please
SMART objectives
Looks rubbish! No animal on it
You're too easy
Lol oh dear
its very nice T-shirt
I hope you didn't cry in your artisan pants too much
Nah dont be silly. I see your movements a mile off
I dont need to nearby, just hear you instead "Grrrrawww I'm Artisan Lion! Grrrrawww". Being subtle isnt your style
Also you dont have any bushes in Dalston, its not progressive enough. If you said "Donkey Stripper bar" then that would be feesable
I dont do FB. Forced by society to use it
Donkeys which are strippers. A guy called Doug owns it who deals on Donkeys Nah I cant/dont cause it dont exist. Only in alt universe
Is it a long awkward shot of someone picking their nose?
Who is that twat?
It is funny tho
I just had a chat with Tim that sits next to you. He told me that you shown him pictures without any context
& Said "Im a developer"
Pictures of me sorry
He said you said "I'm developer" whilst showing him pictures of me
Nothing sweet cheeks
Just thought it was amusing
So what did you really say?
Tizzles been to Shadwell towers yet?
How come Melody leaving? Anyone know?
She get the can becauses she pushed too far
Vice president of Avant garde ideas
I have Doom too if you want to borrow it but one game at time, sweet cheeks
Jokes aside, anyone know the real reason?
Easy sweetcheeks, you seem very excited. playing 8 games at once won't make you happy
You don't have to
Watch "war games"
You don't have to play - Very important rule & tactic
Whatever doers
Oh Dear - I thought you were trolling me. So what does JonesyTown sell? Animals? Nintendo? Vegans?
A wise man once said set the emoji to .
Wagner told him that you parted hard last night
Someone just put him in Uber
What time you finish?
Wagner needs help?
Too deep?
That bad?
Just got abit of emo & depressing
?
Oh really? Sexy times grabs or just give me a hug type of grabs?
Poor guy. Its tricky. Do we not invite him out or confront him?
Good idea. Tho its out of work this happens. They wont care. Plus no one has time. Im lucky to have 5 minute conversation with Matthew
Wiggins doesnt have time
Good idea
I speak to HR 1st
Altho I think how need to frame to Wagner without saying "you have issues"
In terms of speaking with HR, do I say "Wagner has personal issues and I've informed by co-workers of this which may be affecting his perforance & home life"?
HR isn't my strong suit I have to say. Other than "How are you?" and been nice
I so wish we had interior HR, this would be so much easier to speak someone face to face
I will have a think about how to approach this. Maybe for now, we shouldn't invite Wagner out. As sad and mean as it sounds, I think that is kinder thing to do in the long term for him and everyone's ears too
Only you guys know about this in this thread, Tallcheeks. I know you're inner northern wants to broadcast it loudly "Wagner is depressed". If not obvious, please keep this to yourself.
Don't worry. I will figure it out, I always do.
How do you do that?
WTF

What is my name now? Vegan Fuckface

Nice bit of fuctionality, the longer you hold down the emo button bigger the image appears
I like :)
Sorry mate Im have been working on Blippar the past 2 years which is behind the times
ó¾½
True probably get further in a conversation than my deep randomise discussions about vegans
We are all "Jonesyes"
How wow!
Ruby, Why don't you just tell Phil that you're biggest fan and freek him out?
Oh Ruby
You love Wagner
Typical developer logic. Anyone wearing pink = gay. Person likes animals = gay. Wears nice clothes = gay. The world isnt that boolean friendly im afraid
That killed that conversation
ó¾
ó¾
Thats not Evil. That just makes me say "Oh dear"
Chris set his own nickname to Developer Breaker.
ó¾
Will he call up the skinheads fuck everyone up?
I thought it was Steve then
Developer & musician
That was best thing about the film, the rest of film is pretty forgetable
His face is very prisma friendly
Usually Prisma doesnt work with people's faces
Look good I mean (I forgot I speaking with a room with developers who need precise defination of "face friendly")
ó¾
Whats with all of photo rape?
I think Ruby you should watch a film called "Disturbia"
It has alot of shalking in it
Radu's website is so odd, but I cant put on my finger on it.
Just seems like hit his head
A wise man once said changed the chat theme.

A wise man once said changed the chat theme.
you getting a tatt of a donkey? Or lion attacking or riding a donkey?
Tattoo of such events would be awesome
You guys need to make a tv series about office politics
It would be great
Anyone go karting tonight?
ó¾
Anyone for film club tonight? As there is no go karting :(
John Maus is awesome
Blipp rape week I might have to leave film night too. Too much work to do plus I have to go back to Zone 56 to feed my sister cats who are apart of the royal family
Hey moon is a great track
Very sad tho. Given a developer may cry
I descipted the QA process at Blippar which was like "Convincing Zombies to be vegetarians, they going to eat you at some point once they run out of carrots. You're just avoiding the problem, not solving it"
I came across this in elephant & castle. Bowling & Bingo, I think we should go
Its cheap
& very shagwell
Shit but delightful
Tacky but great fun
Near to office & cheap
Go kart alternative
Do you have a tactics to win? I always thought it was luck
You probably see more predictable pattern in it than I can. Like playing hell bullet shoot em up. Always usually patterns in games if you just to focus on the problem enough
Such a small world, I went to uni with that guy
Chris Olsen
Same course
I need to another look when sun isnt glazing on screen - only time when I dont want sun
Just dont tell him or highlight it
Just go your thing without annoncing it to the whole office
Yeah same here. Very solid
Sorry still stuck in zone 54. I feel like prisoner of the deep land of the subards
Im back in land of east tomorrow thankfully
Nah its too bad. Im actually goung through my film list. Watched "The walk" which is pretty good (Team french will love it) & watching Sightseers finally. Its reminds of natual born killers.
"He said he would shit on my hand and use it as brown lipstick" What a line.
Does know the plan for this dinner thing at Stephine's house (french girl)?
RUBAGE
Anyone up for checking this out next weekend? 
Looks mental in a good way
Also had fans chase me & Sam down the street
No Ruby
Yeah it was refreshing although we were like pork pies at jewish wedding
Thats what I love about London
So many commuties with different expecatations & values
Its very south london pub
So different from Hipster pubs in the land of the east
Yeah typical south
I was dispointed that no one told me "to fuck myself"
Nah you dont do that in southie mate. They steal your phone
If you want 
Ruby
Youtube
Yeah private
Oh dear - do I have to watch these?
Any vegans on it?
I think the remake should be "the invasion of the Vegans"
Vegans are more scary than aliens
All expect for the last one - kingdom of the crystal ass or whatever it called. My great grandfather is probably rolling in his grave because of that movie
1st 3 are classics
You haven't been living East London that long, you will meet some more vegans no doubt
Who said I was passionate about it, I fear for the planet of the vegans
Sorry I won't be able to come for a drink tonight. Could we do bday drinks and film on Wednesday?
Ok should we watch either bioshock like film or northen film or film with giants in it on Wed for Sam?
Does the suggusted film include any of 3 things?
No worries, this thread has no context, just things which are loosely related to animals on a planet
That start up article sums up Blippar really well
You liked my shoes & socks? I think they are art on my feet.
Classic artisan uniform you mean
Fart lol
oh that sucks :( I got you a ticket to David cage thing if you want go to that?
Mike Harris
Samir oh dear
head - I saw you at Dalston, sorry I didnt say "Hi" in a hurry to the office
Does anyone have 70's scifi movie called westworld? I really like the sound of it
Robot filled fantasy theme park
ó¾
Thats what I have to say about that
Nah
Working from home I should of people I work with
Sorry "I mean you should of asked the people I work with"
Anyone up going to this on Satursday 2ish? 
What because one is white & one is brown? You racist!
That is actually a good name for a band
Or the "Animal Joneses"
The jonesy Animal
The Animal called Jones
Jonesy in the Animal
if you prefer, Jonesy on the Animal or Animal on the Jonesy
Really? Ok myself & Lion are meeting Hackney central at 1.30pm to head up there via train. Get there 2ish
I always fantasised about unleashing horde of animals in shopping centre & lock all the doors. See who survices & how? Would Lions attack the perfume  women because smell nice? Would bulls attack burger king staff? It is real living sand box experiment.
I mean Lions *not* attack the perfume women
Indeedo
You would go  on a violeance ramage? The media would call it "The Ruby Rampage". Sounds quite good actually, if only worked at "The Sun".
I never seen Blue Brothers :( Another one on the list
That is next gen dumbness
Im amazed that Radu is still around
I would thought someone would fired him long ago
I guess he works things no one else can nor cares about it but has value for the business
Yeah true
I hear that Martin was quite good created the peel mode & logic & maths behind that
Disaffected?
Martin has shares in the company
Still
You would thought they would buy him off
I guess like they say "the higher you climb the tree, the more you see of monkey's ass"
It was such mess, as Ruby would say "It doesn't make sense". Just slap lots of ideas which wasn't conherence. It was like agile film making slaping lots of random scenes & set pieces together. Such a shame could of been good
No depth or reason for their actions which annoy me the most
Yeah. Oh bummer, you alright?
You were running on all fours weren't you? I told you can't run around like a lion
Probably landed your foot on a odd angle & twisted without you realising it. I would use Tiger plam its quite good for muscle pain. It burns but looses the muscles
Maybe you need someone to ludo crop your foot like in those Chinese herbal places (not sure what they are called)
No worries I leave it for today.
Lets go to board game pub later
What time people are getting there? unless you wanna meet there eariler? Walking & London is like pea & carrots, you cant have without the other. So pub is probably the best bet or a film
I remember we talking about making a kids story book, were you serious? I may have a idea.
I had a brainstorm (I know its not PC - I dont give a monkeys for PC term - Idea gathering whatever it is) so Im writting it up now
The kids story outline anyway Yes at the fox pub (Hipster land)
Oh Lion was talking saying "brainstorming" its nah nah word to say these days
I think you both need to join UKIP. They love your racist rants.
Who is Garold? One of your friends?
I cant remember sorry although I do meet like 5 new people at Blippar each day
Roarrrrr - I've shared ya a doc for a concept outline to your Blippar account.
Its very rough but its a start
Let me know your thoughts. If its bollocks, no worries. Come up with another concept
Yeah Im need to finish the GDD for robot game concept
When are people going to the pub?
I think its good to go new places anyway regardless its full or not. Just good to see it
Just left now, didnt realise the time. Still going the drarts pub in haggerston?
So you're at Scenerio bar now?
Im on Ridley market, should I head towards Dalston Junction or towards Stoke?
What about little nan's?
Have you seen any vegans yet? You have to careful they may attack for your meat product
You gone to sleep yet guys? I just woke up, on the quest to find a gleasy spoon
Will it be on BBC iPlayer tonight? I never watch live content anymore. Usually wait till its on streamimg service like Netflix or whatever
I dont think I can cinerma tonight, head is still hurting. Maybe we could see the film on Wednesday?
Up for it Wednesday?
Ruby you seemed confused by my interaction
& shocked
Only said "Ruby" at you
Indeedo & saying your nickname shouldnt be shocking but delightful to hear your name called
Busy man sweetcheeks
I think my Vegan trend is misunderstood. I love a female Vegan, suck you dry epesically if you eat beef.
The Girl With All The Gifts is being show tomorrow at 8.30pm at Odeon in Lecester Square. Up for it? - Anyone else up for it? Samir on dear?
Anyone up for seeing The Girl With All The Gifts tonight? British Zombie film
Ruby you have work? Really?
I thought you were creator or god of "Ruby on wheels"?
ó¾
Bummer, you cant seem to change  the default emjo one. I wanted to place oversizes animals but you cant. Perhaps this is MVP for FB messager
Still in Thmasside?
Face Raped again
Whats the alpha for?
Bummer Im in line to buy Kraftwerk, Im at position 1543 in quene. I doubt I get tickets but fingers crossed
How many people does Royal Albert fit 20k?
Mmmm still unlikely :(
Whatever face rape sam
No tickets :(
The Blurry Russian Rubies
That kid only achieved the best record by 1 second. That was intense "That was it, That was it!"
We could do this! Go to Escape Room its in Dalston
Loading bar sounds good too
No body wants to go a escape room? They are awesome
Man you love wrestling
Works out about 15 - 20 each if we get 5 of us to go
Moody londoners huh
Sorry mate been busy today trying solve domenstic problems, where do I put my pictures up, where to place my storage, cleaning my house zzzzz
I think dictorship will accerate american culture filling the country with Golden plated Trump statues with quotes like "Kill Mexican & dont be Mexi can't"
I think that is the future
"Escape from LA" will happen
Has any seen Stargate recently? Its so bad. Such a bummer as the concept is pretty cool
Hasnt dates too well
Dated
Sorry I meant the film but no doubt the TV show us just as bad
is just as bad
I really like the concept. Shame about execution
Was it great then? I cant remember
Yeah same
Sonic 3 still is
Just cant remember if Stargate was even good. Maybe it wasnt because I would remembered it. Being that age you certainly more impressable. I remember thinking Blink 182 & the offspring were amazing as they were 21st punk bands got into
1st punk bands
He sums up really well actually. No sense of wonder for something that should as the concept is cool
Ive attempted but looks like same old thing. Although If I knew other people like a group of us  Horge is amazing coop experience if you have 4/5of you playing together
Maybe Xmas present for myself Xbone as I would like to Recore as well or a sound bar
Maybe its worth waiting for black friday sales
I will feel like farted in the room
Thats more like it. Some IM exchanges
Social interactions
It was interesting conversation with Lion boy earlier regarding the SMART donkey movement.
Strong - I didnt realise that you were cheap
I should pimp you out
That cheap I mean
Im heading home I have 3 interviews tomorrow. I hate listening to Twats to say & claim how great they are but know fuck all.
Thats the game, right? They want a job, you have figure out if they are right for the job of blipprape
Yeah looks lovely. Not so sure if it will play that well as its old skoll Side scrolling shoot em up & the game is based on enemy patterns. As player you are figuring out the patterns/how to fight enemies. The patterns look quite typical & wont be hard to learn or master = boring game
The reason why gunstar heroes is a classic that each level has completely different play style & enemy patterns. Also so unique to that game especailly the bosses
was he your hero? Did he inspired to create Ruby on Wheels?
Any donkeys in ut?
It
Going now to Shoreditch - chop chop
Howdy me & Shaun are ourside Shadwell, where are you?
Whats the flat number?
Only just got up a few hours ago, yeah it was very unpredictable good night out
Too fucked to left my flat 2bh
But normally always up for gamage
Anyone up for walking around Hackney Wick/canal? Then pop to mine for gameage. Or come around later for Gamage?
I just wanting to try out overcooked & Push you pull me. Great co-op games
Funny you say that. Thats why Im on my way to Strafford to buy bin raider & Hackney wick is on the way. Maybe we do some gamage later
What does Rockstar icon mean? Red dead 3?
I wonder what period/setting this red dead will be cause the last one was 1910's which was suprise when you reach a city
Thats on my list. Bought bin raider so probably playing that next few weeks along with hyper light drifter
Yeah just put TR on now, title screen looks nice :)
Maybe we could play some co-op later
Same I need a chilled one. There is co-op mode
I think its like portal 2 co-op. SP levels designed for co-op
Yeah indeedo hell divers is very fun. You guys come to my place sometime as I have lots of fun co-op where you actually share a screen like the old days
I have lots of fun co-op games I mean
Yeah wanna do that next weekend
Maybe after Lion's party
On friday
Where are you in bin raider? Just started hurting in the snow
I wasnt a fan of creep. Good backstory to how the killer came about but wasnt that frighting or mysterious after the fact
Hellrasier is fucked up, I havent seen that in years
Did you guys watch the Louis Theroux Scientology documentary? Any good?
Yeah cant wait for the new Black mirror series. Charlie Brooker is a genius
I predict that new Red dead 2 will come out in May 2017
I wonder who is developing rockstar north or rockstar vancover who did the 1st one?
What happened?
Jeff punched him in the face?
Jeff just ripped into him? Poor guy
Best sandbox game ever
Along with fallout 3
London gaming market - you have a link?
Actually we just get a ticket on the say right?
Day not say
Just been watching peep show - Season 9. Its back to form, so funny. I thought the last season was abit meh
Yeah just watched BallPit episode
"She is just old homeless ballpit witch"
Its amazing
I told you Vegans are taking over
Planet of the vegans
Not sure where he gets energy from to direct such epic movies being a vegan
I think both posters are awesome
My friend who works at Sega claims that Nintendo will annonce & show Ninteno DX today
Exciting stuff
Oh is it?
Nice idea especailly as Schools becoming more tory these days with no Art classes & banking classes instead
Great day for gaming
Oh Ruby
Lol what is the book about?
Darn that is deep stuff. Training them is deep learning right?
Tory own the media so they spin the story to make Lilly & Gary look like cunts
"Imports" (their words & not mine) cost them money which they dont want to spend it on
It's alot of rape in the QA land, not sure if I'ill be able come out till later
There is 10 seats upstairs graaawwww
Plenty of seats
Rrrrrrr
And its warm roooooarrrr
No room sweetcheaks
Plenty of room up here
For all of fatties
& letture
Yes we can all fit
Where you going?
We have grabbed Steve Masen
You betta have a plan
Mother fuckers
Where you gone? Where you on 149 bus to Shoreditch?
We are on 149 bus to Shoreditch
You need to listen  your answser phone messages
How old is Steve?
Reminds me of clint eastwood
Yeah I like him. He certainly keep things close to the cheat & sticks to his princles. Very old skool
Lol
Anyone up for anything tomorrow? Fancy some gamage over mine?
You should do Lion King night :P
I should go vegfest. You would certainly get alot of letture
Why not? Im sure people are  open for range of activities with the loose theme of Veg
Wow just watched 1st Episode of Black mirror. That was awesome
So dark. Im actually abit depressed & wonder if the world become like that. Score based. Using points to comform human behaviour
Yeah true. Its the metadrama of how & social commenatary of how people are in that world
That happens to me all time but I dont upset. But again my life value doesnt count on it nor Am i social media personality type.
Yeah indeedo
I think FB causes alot of harm actually
Also what you can be what you want to see you as rather who you actually are. I think its sad when you people post a photo of every meal. Just need attention or valuation for their actions
Just clearly trying to create positive & fake version of themselves
Strangle world we live in
I wonder what is the next step? FB, Youtude, Snapchat, etc is all web 3.0 idealogy where you as the user is the content. FB is only the beginning. Maybe the next step is like "Ex-machina" where the content will genrated to your pensonality/likes
Social media is like a map of what  we are like as humans rather just a map of things we like
Its very basic its using tags to determine this. Its not like an AI that learning about you & adapts the rules & filters according you & how you feel. Whatever that is the next step I dont know
Do wonder how far will go in embed in our daily lifes? Could get to point that wont need a passport, just people would use your FB account to confirm all of your details. Imagine if they could use it to determine who are you & Judge you on that alone. Get to airport & say "Sorry you can't go to  South American, you die & do too much drugs"
Or "Can't go to France, you're not high brow enough. You would upset them"
I think I prefer my prediction for future .Fuck FB, love a donkey. Mecha animals are the future.
Like a "bear tank who uses a mini gun"
Or your own personal plane like Eagle
That is mecha bit to make them super animals
Also you could implant Google GPS to know where to go
AI systems to make more advanced at partilaur functions
Does it have any Donkeys in it?
Epic fail
That is awesome! 85 bucks tho better be blessed by vegan alien fan (Alien make the person turn into a vegan)
Just watched 2nd episode of Black mirror the AR one. I thought it was great, I thought the ending was abit meh
Blippar probably stole from nintendo
I thought episode 3 is weakest one Ive seen so far
Just seemed underwelming & not the orignal/strong as a concept
Still solid thi
Thi
Thi
I mean tho
Just started watching 4. The girl with glasses is so boneable
& cute
So far Black Mirror still remains fresh & orignal which is suprising consisting its season 3. Although I think season 2 is better so far. Then again it has only 3 episodes, they were all films or better than films in fact. Each one has a such strong message to say.
If you guys not seen season 2 I highly recommend
Well done Ruby. I thought you were going to say "I only watch Eastenders & football, mate"
& "X-factor"
Watch season 2
Ok what other shows or films are about this topic or theme?
I certainly like watch more stuff like this if its out there
Technology meets society/social mores
OK like what?
Its on my book list
I bought animal farm still need to read
Going by that logic nothing is orignal
As humans we are always inspired by something
I think its method of delivery & format that is orignal. That was is only thing you can measure as unless you know of source material or inspiration of the creator
In summary, nothing is orignal. How sad :(
I think its all about Donkey bars in Dalston
Shoreditch is central London now its so busy although I do enjoy it if I have the energy (Im getting old)
I was dispointed that we didnt go on a quest to find Lion themed bars on Lion's leave do
Oh yes he going to move to MV right?
Although I dont know too well. The only thing I know is that he is french
Could come for one & fuck off to food shopping. As i need to go Sainsburys anyway
do you want a kebab?
I can ask if it will be blessed by vegan?
Will the movie feature any animals of any kind?
I find its hard to communicate the rules to come up/define what makes good files. If you just tell a junior exactly what fomat/size they are never going to learn the why which is more important for the long term otherwise you have spoon fed all the time.
I mean spoon feed them all the time
Its hard working with juniors
Glad I dont have to anymore
I will get one of my donkeys to deliver your book for you. Then you realise the true potentional of SMART donkeys
Regarding bitmap book, didnt we met the guy who wrote it? I remember buying Sega mega drive book from him. It was at games market thing
We should go again. Its next sunday, not this coming Sunday
Lol be great to interact with his joystick to see his reactions with you playing the game on his face
I like how he compares to T-800 model terminator to Nokia 3210
Great stuff
For me the virtual poltician episode was my fave written episode. It had many pure satrie moments really funny & awkward yet heart breaking at the same time
Everyone finished episode 5 yet? I dont want to leak any sploters
I agree :) I agree although I think enjoyed 4 most because of the cute chick with glasses. I thought conceptually episode 1 was most interesting & also reminded of Community episode which comletely rips the piss out of social media
1st time we can all agree on something that is logically acceptable :P
I have to see how Im feeling as I have 5/6 meetings today.A day of possible Blipprage with 2 of them will be diffcult & awkward - "WTF give me what I need to do my Job & get on with it"
I wasnt a fan of cloverfield lane. It felt like 5 type films smashed together, without any development of each film/story thread. Producers wet dream random scenes from other movies put together. Save money & make lots of money. Really liked the 1st half then went off rails.
I really enjoyed 45 mins as you say the characters & situcation was interesting then it became a murder mystery, survivor fight for right to live, sci-fi end of world in space of 20 mins. Just didnt seem conherence or give any time to reflect on what happened. The plot devices to push things along were really forced
Yeah same thing happened when I worked at Creative Assembley. CEO used to be the lead games designer & need to become CEO as the business needed it. We just said that "Im game maker, not a global business guy so I got someone who is better at this"
Refreshing humble & honest which one of things I miss working in games
Ive been waiting for their review, I may amazon prime it for this weekend
See how I feel. Not sure If I can survive pass 10pm. Its a bit rapey week
It was pretty fun. Although ended quite early as you soon realise you have nothing in commom with these people other than you work at Blippar especailly their taste in music.
Im not a fan of in office parties, always should do outside in a venue. Just avoid that clash of people fighting what crap they want to play
I think pissed a few people off too
I dont care. People from marketing or whatever. Its interesting how Blippar is changing. I guess you realise how actually Tech/geek team are small part of Blippar
I thought there was more geeks. Actually Blippar is filled with business twats which you need of course but it is ratio wise is odd
Probably did. Alot of people were joining in & then I got the blame lol
Yeah that was fun, people keen stealing the ham
Nah just vibes. Some people were abit of "Oh costume I bought from a shop" with nose up on the air
Lol oh dear
How was the rave last night? did you get any new fans & create your own religion?
Shame I didnt go, I was super tired with a week of rape
You could of said "Im Samir Oh Dear, the new Jesus"
Lol great stuff
Oh yeah I thought she was someone else
You guys should get this game, its basically farcry with zombies & 5 player co-op. So we can play together to in the same world. Its pretty fun & £20 on Amazon for all DLC so its great value. It been a great Xmas game to play.
Sorry say again. You talking about that sea of theves by RARE
Im temped to buy a xbone for that game
Gears 4 although its another sequal
& Gears 4 sorry
Yeah it is. Rare are Microsoft owned unless MS will start developing for multi platform like Nintendo. MS are slower than Nintendo. Would probably take 5 years to make a decision to do it & 5 years to make it happen
Memory lane. I remember playing Tomb Raider back in 96
 and I was blown away.
I think article is better as has more detail but it's worth a watch
I dont have much faith that MS will support it for long. They always do these experiments, then they never take it further. Its like they do to keep stakeholders or increase the value of their stakes
Sorry i mean keep stakeholders happy
At least when Google or apple they keep at it till they know its total failure or success
Did anyone get tickets to see John Carpetter tomorrow night?
He is ny hero
My hero
When Im 60 something I want to be like him
You love him, made all of scifi & horror classics
Oh dear
Or drugs
Kids like drugs
Did your cleaner say "Can I have the whole box?" or she say "Box?"
Who is she? Some tad who ate some razar blades did died? What a suprise, dumpass
I cant remember offering Oliver anything although I enjoyed interacting with Oliver. Wasnt a big fan of the owner, cant even remember her name
Ok that old chestnut of story
How was your 1st day on your new job? Did you roar at anyone?
Or they should just make up & get on.
I would of thought that Rob is driving you potty with the lens business?
So no ham talk, lion talk, ruby talk or vegan talk at your new company?
Seems abit boring mate, why you work there?
I bet about talk about their cats & what food they are going to cook tonight
You need to shake that up
I bet that they have better HR than Blippar tho
the whole interstellar project is a mess, no one knows what is going on
What you actually have to make/deliever you mean?
Who makes the decisions what the learning lens is? Chooses what will be delievered? Steve?
There is 14 other fruit attack games?
COB?
Cock on my Bum
?
Cod on Bun?
What does it mean?
Thats boring 
At least you can kiss the girls & not worry aboutthe  poltics of it back firing with your company. Seen harcore break ups with peop at the same company both in senior positions - what a shitstorm
For everyone & them
Lol pretty same thing at company I worked at. Apprently they once had one meeting together & instead talking to each other they get other people in the room pass on what they said.
It was coprate so they had too many chefs anyway & red tape
It is funny
Pretty awkward for the people in the room.
Could be worse. Couldn't be one she had a affair with & the guy didnt know it was you
Rename "Ruby - Soul & Marrage breaker"
Rename you with a new code name "Ruby - Soul & Marrage breaker"
Amazing
Anyone up for this on friday? 
Johnny greenwood from Radiohead - his side project with india artist
You should include something about lions & roaring but I cant think right now
what you working on? Have you been dumped this huge project in development (sort thus shit out) or are you working on building a project having lots of meetings to meet people & figure out how to improve the process?
T2 just looks like it doesnt need to exist. Although then again T1 for me as such cultural & iconal classic film of the 90's, I just love it & it had a good message too. I cant imagine you re-create that for today. Its like making sequal to scarface or something, its such 80's film.
Its a cash cow. The movie studio owns Danny Boyle now so his last film "Steve Jobs" which is very good actually flopped in big time. The Studio just wants their their money back & forces the director to make what they want for profits. Its rare to see directors do what they want to make. Most films made to please the investors
Face Rape
still at the pub?
Coming now
NICOLAS RUBAGE
I cant comment on the artist. I like the Nest Venue usually plays good music
Are you guys going fireworks tomorrow & up for the games market on sunday?
Hi Sam, we got a table next door in the draft house
a quick bone huh?
I need a disco nap too
Samir idea was market during the day then board games pub afterwards on Sunday. Anyone up for this?
I'm going for a disco nap
I'm getting old
I am actually 33 you know
ticket for what? To see "The Vegan Donkeys who like Ham"?
No ticket to see vegan donkeys then?
I know you are developer but I look nothing like a ticket to see the vegan donkeys
English?
Either of you didnt answer my question?
Tight?
No ticket to see vegan donkeys then?
ticket for what? To see "The Vegan Donkeys who like Ham"?
What ticket?
To ticket to what?
You going straight to the nest or going somewhere before?
Awesome night, we should do that more often.
I was just trying to spice up the party. It was pretty crappy but then again I think work parties are always abit crap
Samir's pill face. So funny last night, he tried with a few ladies. Their faces was said "oh dear pill face man" & walk off. He had right moves & everything, just the face killed it everytime. I wish I took a photo now
The problem simply is everyone has a different idea of "fun" end up being party of commitee. "End up with a camel, when you trying creat a horse
Is that phyics based power stone 4 player fighting game?
I remember getting Samir to drink lots of water convincing him it was Russian Volka
Last night I mean
Oh dear
000
Fat fingers again
Yeah hahaha
I think the ham was the best thing about that party. I dont think Vicky would agree
Throwing it around was fun
True I never thought of it in that way. I just viewed it as pushing the boundaries rather challenging or making a joke of a costume party
You use alot of fancy words, you have a good vocabulary. I had to google some to find what they mean.
Oh dear
Anyone up for this today? 
Im going to get there for 12ish, getting up now
I know you're up for it, I wondering if anyone else is up for it? This isn't Leon only channel sweetcheeks
Next gen problems
To the house party? You talking about?
Missile defence? I dont understand a phase you are saying. You declaring vartiables again
?
Just why? Why did you make all effect in his name making in food?
So funny, why did make all that effect to write his name in food?
Great explantion - use that jail free card if needed Ruby
The world is over, although I look forward to seeing Golden plated statues of thump with a M16 in the air alround the US.
Each town will have one doing a different action. Maybe Mexican town it say "Be a mexican not mexican't & help me build that wall"
In redneck town, there been statue of him on the shiter "I love to crap. Being an american, you crap like no other"
Yeah makes me want like the people on "True Romance" & just stupidly happy without thinking
Looking at this trump thing from historial point of view. Every great nation who have great impact on the world have a dictator some point, I guess this is American's dictator giving people what they need. A direction or focus.
Scary thing is that direction or focus
Is he a Hitler or Caso?
Just left the office, my bum feels sore from the daily blipprape. Need to go home
Im afraid
Deadlines for the new app are stupid
Will your food be blessed by Vegan?
Its whatever they say it or not, its purely placebo effect
If you say it has, I may taste better in your mind which why you pay more for it
If you're a Vegan maybe you can sense other Vegans blessings
Yes exactly
Or its a con job
NICOLAS RUBAGE
You have alot of clones
I dont follow Ruby. Are you saying you look like hero in krull? Sorry its been a long day of rape
its still pretty good for its time. Still watchable & enjoyable, watched a few years ago over xmas
well thank you. Not sure where "you" as a rubage would fill in Krull universe. Maybe you're a wizard
Why are using my face to troll anti Trump posts? I want a cut. Also I love Trump, I look forward to seeing many Golden statues of him around the world, shotting down mexicans with his Trump M16.
I looking to Trump movement of changing the world for the better
Ruby face raper
Varerian film reminds me of guardians of the galaxy one of my fave marvel films because so out there & sci-fi
Looks like fun which most hollywood films arent these days
Anyone up to Arrival tomorrow night at Hackney picturehouse?
8.45pm
Just finished watching Equilibrum - quite enjoyable crappy sci-fi film
Suprisingly it didnt end up with lots of sequels
They have abilities due to high level trainning without emotions. Because of course you punch & fire without feeling anything.
Yeah Bean typically gets killed in 1st 10 mins. I like him as a actor but likes to be killed off. I cant think of one film where he doesnt get killed
Great space epic
Far easier to understand than Interstellar
Fan mail - where is that?
I show this to anyone who asks me stupid questions. Polite fuck off
Where you go?
Upstairs?
Cant see you
Reverse psycology warfare
Also dumbed down to primal elements which of course UKIP voters love
Whats chicken sll sbout?
All about
Its a simple to understand statement right?
Especially for americans. Elephants represent Left & Donkeys represent Right parties
My donkey keen my safe
Me safe i mean
Did you think about your protest tactics further? You going to bring some donkeys along. UKIP voters would start petting them & you would say "these are polish donkeys".
I think you can Ruby, you just dont want to. You're developer, creator of worlds & "Ruby on wheels"
Watching Cowboy Debob I've forgotten how awesome it is
Its short & sweet as well with like 18 episodes like Firefly
Im going to this
Games warehouse event at 8, will get Maruel's house about 11ish/12ish
Im sure you'rw figure it out
Howdy im ourside. Flat 16 right?
Great night guys! We have do more house parties :)
Ruby - what you do to him?
Well I can't remember seeing him write anything in this thread. Maybe all this geek talk about Ghost in the shell, Donkeys, Board games is just too much for him.
That is Croydon for you
I remember I used to visit a mate who lived in estate in Croydon. He used to have group of chavs that would smash his windows each week & report them to police. They pretty much said "If we send to jail, they be out in a week so we rather keep here to prevent real trouble (murders). If dont want that, don't live here". That was 15 years ago so I cant imagine what it is like now.
You dont want ti
Shadwell is amazing compaired to surrounding areas of Croydon
Dis she ask to take photos of donkeys?
Thats the only thing that mattera
*Did
I was thinking "Why I am doing this shit? Not developing the next gen donkeys AKA "Smart Donkeys" instead.
Thinking "what a waste of talent working on this shit!"
Smart Donkeys could help mankind. Whereas app that blipps people WTF
I think we could do the 1st Satire games studio
Makes political satire games using abstract ideas. Mario having jump on the poor to stealing their coins which you use to gain more powers which steal more money. As you play same levels, enviroments level of affluent changes according to these actions.
Exactly same game concept
Not same. I mean satrice themed
In theme
Make no money but you certainly get respected
Its very hard to do both - Get respect (creative) & be popular (actual make money). Surely one or other
What do you post?
Oh dear
Anyone interested to going this Sat? 
Its adventure expo
*adventure point n click games
I wonder if you need play the 1st dishonored game to understand the story of the sequal? I really liked 1st one but never finished it as I just didnt have the patience as it was so unforgiving. Universe was awesome
Mechanics could of been better
I havent played deadly tower u recommend a play?
Yeah I'm up for games night
I bring my PS4 & Pads I have lots of good MP & CO-OP games
or you come around my place either way
Never hear of any of them, but sound intersting
He is a joker
I think you need to fight for your right to your ideas but hard to convinue a dumbass. Fight with logic
Say we spend this amount of time, cant start again
I feel sorry for Steph for learning lens
He is contractor QA guy
Glad you're getting on
I thought he made you cry
No dont do that
I work with the guy
I think Tim & Mattrew will solve the scoping problem. Once there is product/feature scoping system everything will be alot easier. The challenge they have is controlling king clowns - Steve, Rish or Omar (although he is mastermind but doesnt understand people)
Pivo? New drug?
Will there be any Vegans or Donkeys there?
Just playing tower of monsters. I think its quite smart for what it is like you have director talking over the scenes as if you're in movie. Good way to give some context to random game scenerios. Its pretty fun
Funny you didnt strike me as Metallica fan. Black or master of puppets are my fave albums of their
That thump movie was amazing. What great production values for anti thump video
I enjoyed the new Kong trailer looks like fun
GITS I have mixed feelings. Anything cyber punk is great but not a fan of remakes rarely transition from old to morden works
Easy money. Spiderman prints money
Ghost In The Shell
Change of topic; next year is going to be great for sci-fi as blade runner 2 isn't? Or Alien 5? Along with Star Wars episode 8
I enjoyed Guardians 1 probably one of fave marvel films
Yeah crazy year
wanna see arrival this weekend? Sam surely you dont have to work on poo profile
Just watched a film "Dont breathe", good old fashion suspense horror film hunted by killer. I Recommend, its good fun
I will go & see "Arrival" this weekend, sorry it wont be on for long. Its not hollywood blockbuster.
I think you like this 
Im up for that. Could do it over Xmas, im hoping I can get 3 weeks off
RippAR is giving us 7 days without booking any holiday this year. Shock horror
Myself & Lion are going to see Arrival tonight at 8.45pm at Rio in Dalston, anyone want to join? I hear the film contains rubies, northerns, drugs, space & aliens. What more you want?
I find this amusing 
I did fart or something?
Oh Chris & Ruby
Yes indeedo roasty time
Vegans & donkeys will be there and drugs
And chicken
I've actually been temped to buy vinyl for tubro kid. Its great soundtrack, one of few DJs I like.
*few french DJs
You're back, I thought you left the channel forever?
Matthew is leaving. What a shitstorm
Yup his friends are doing a start up & he beung offered CTO role
Exactly
So annoying cause Mattrew was only one who gets software development process. Blippar will become worse
You say but some people find me my accent hard to understand as my accent is typical southeastern
*You say that but some
Cheers big ears
Our conversations are very unique. I bet you never had a indepth discussion about the possible social impact & socal mores of mech donkeys changing the poltical landscale of a shit animals becoming intergated transport method of London
Ok I mean before coming to London. I bet you never had such discussion in Amsterdam
Dont get too exited
Excited
Another USP for a Smart Donkey. You can milk them
Never tried donkey milk if anything like goat's milk, its very sour
For all sizes instead. With giants like Sam, he just recommend him to buy the chariot set. Which is at least 3 donkeys
Im doing no donkey centipede, so it would have to 3 different donkeys & you better name them
Oh Sam so developer
Im going to start a kickstarter soon
For one of rewards - Ask say something in northern & record it.
For one reward - ask you write something in Ruby using Ruby on wheels
?
You could come around mine I have 50 inch TV. Need someone PS4 pads
Im into old skool MP share screen games, none of this PC linking
Stuff
The lions would win by throwing themselves in till sun exploses. Leaving a few to survive to continue the lion legency on another planet
I can only hear Train because im on the train.
What was the conclusion for tomorrow games night? I cant keep up anymore
Epic blank
Ok how many of you want to come to my place?
I dont have any food but we can pop out to get some
Awesome bring PS4 pads & donkeys
I will leave work at 7ish, get home for 7.30pm. Come over then but it seems to happening at Nick's now
Its probably easier from Shadwell to go liverpool st & get a national train to Clapton, only 3 stops. With overground its 3 changes for you
Overground route would be to Dalston junction, Dalston kinglands to Hackney central & hackney central to Clapton
Yeah its a quest
My address is: Flat 10, E5 9GB. Let me know what you guys want to do
Yes
A word of warming you will all be called "Diamond", "Sweetcheeks", "Geezer", "Darling" at some point by a random person on the journey to my flat.
Yeah I have wired 360 controller & 3 PS4 pads but would be good to have at least 5/6 pads for PS4 as I have 5/6 player games you all play once without having turns
I'm happy to cook but I'm not into dishes that take 3 hours. Simple tings
Exactly - simple tings like curry. Not some vegan blessed lasagne which is very fussy where you need to speak to pasta for 5 hours
Ok I have to cancel tonight anyway I have to do a late one :(
Sunday be better yeah
Just watched "Victoria" that all one take bank heist film, awesome very intense. Its on netflix, I recommend a watch
So intense that im watching "the dark crystal" now to balance it out. Some furry creatices saving the world.
I don't know its got all of animals in it making funny sounds. Its dark in a funny disney way
I remember reading that they were making a dark crystal 2
No CGI, good old fashioned muppets
Im more scared of David Bowie tights balls in Labyrinth than anything in dark crystal
He is my favourite
I like how the podlings are much much Italians
Pretty much
Samir oh smackdown
Is this banglore office? It looks like filled with dorks
There is no grey carpet in London office. You can't foul me Ruby Developer God.
That is Steve?
Next gen rubage
Its all abit of Fallout isnt it? Imagine living in that.
Yeah its very good, annoying I bought it before :( That are great developers
Talking turn based Stragey games been playing alot of Xcom 2, probably my game of year. You need invest but you get into wow what a game. Next gen verison of fire emblem.
Ruby Rogue
"He has gone against the system to invent his own system which allows him to says names randomly in conversation"
"Convert Chris invented Cyper Donkeys to infiltrate the social  system to get people to question their place in the system or means it in"
"Ruby Rogue doesn't know what to do with cyber Donkeys as it is not logical for his Ruby on wheels system, so he evolves and creates Donkeys on wheels which says people names."
It be called "Planet of the Donkeys" and there will be scene when the lead Donkey "Dave" says "No" to his captor
You see, he got the right idea. That is the future! Pet and Seat was a combo :)
That vegan video is so wrong!
He loves the Ruby
I personally perfer Half life 1, halo or Goldeneye
In terms of orignality no but in terms of game/level design, it was amazing in everyway
Flood level is one of my fave SP level in shooter ever
Yeah forced you adapt to your weapons rather using the weapn you want for your situcation which made the combat so interesting
Yeah indeedo. Also I really like how the levels were huge like sandboxs rather than just corridors
Really liked the AI how they fought also each other
Floot vs Convent or whatever they were called
I always thought as concept for shooter, you could watch other deathmatchs as a audience in a studium or areana
Maybe deathmatch in a sphere
As contender you could destory walls & enter othere arenas (deathmatchs)
True. Game design is actually really difficult as there is so many things to think about. Defo look forward to have some time off to do some
Interstellar Shit is killing me
Just need something simple & achieveable
Discovery Lens is a complete mess
Pretty much. I dont think they understand how to make products
Just stick to tech
You hit the nail on the head
I think this is why Matthew really left. Probably knew that he wasnt going to do the change he wanted
5 seconds of fame tho
Its such a shame, great people, shit management
Yeah that is possibility although being a start-up is a hard life
Unless you have a product to sell straight away before you start
Call the company "Ruby Bones" or "Ruby Donkeys" or to get all developers excited "Ruby on Wheels"
I love it. Pure chaos theory, you could never predict that outcome
I think you should of at least attempted to explain a little
Talking about physics engine game. Always thought it been cool if you had procedural created city which had a earthquake. You could be a random person in a city & you can try to get out of city & survive. For an example, you could be in a building that would collpese & you have to get out.
Could be a MP where you have help other players in a city to reach the safe zone. You have work together to make safe passage & objects to do so.
Anyway im getting excited over physics engine I need to get out more
Is Samir oh dear back in London yet?
Im working today & tomorrow, I need a new job
Or get out of the house
Yeah I'm really looking to 3 weeks off for Xmas
lol oh dear
I like Can, you don't dig him?
Well he enjoys my donkey rants
Really? I thought mech donkeys is quite simple concept (not implemnetation of course)
What is Can like? You like him?
Omar is OK, he is just robot.
I respect him most out of senior managment, he knows his limitions. Really he is R&D guy, to give techincal direction rather than manage people
How would he fuck you up? With his 9 arses?
Exciting day for game annoncements - last of us 2, new uncharted SP DLC, Raparra the rapper remaster, Marvel vs Capcom 4
Be interesting to see how these characters relationship develop/change. Games rarely do over that over series of games
Anyone fancy popping out a beer tonight around East? Its been a week of rape & I need a beer
It doesnt help that tories mates own all train services so they just want to milk you poor dry
Anyone up for going to Cheap euro holiday for 1st week of Jan? You can get to return flight to Barcelona for like £120.
Berlin could be good although I will be cold.
Madrid be warmer
You up for Barcelona around 18th Feb? For reals or is this dream talk?
have you been Barcelona before? If you havent, you should come as hot lioness & art around each corner, you love it
WTF is that? Cut out of a face on a chair? Bloody creepy
Yeah indeedo Im up for that. Hopefully Im not zzzzz, I have to do another late one tonight. One last night of RapeSteller
Just Question which has just occured to me; how would vegan gamer work? Would the games have to feature Vegan characters? Or the controllers/input to the game is vegan like they use a carrot as a interface? I wonder.....
Well we have Android to do, fuck this face last min rubbish. At least Steve pulling in the hours
What a waste guy
Its over soon either way
From the waste guy?
I love it if it works. Tinder is a dead minefield these days
That cluserfuck of it all is that its being delayed for another 2 weeks
All this PR is something which isnt ready
The cats got the right idea
They see the future
Sorry I'm half asleep, is that games thing happening tomorrow or another day?
I thought it was a visual metaphor for a sad donkey
We should go to this. Its in Stoke Newington 
This is very cool but scary 
Next gen headphones
Sadly I'm still working intershit app then, cant wait till its gone.
That article sums it up quite well
About to make a move from the office, I shall meet at the Loading bar
Probably get there for 7ish, you guys still going?
Will we have time? As its a early start time for the show I mean
A donkey is a way of life, not just for xmas
I would defo play it if it featured donkeys in space
Next gen fuckup
Will there be any donkeys at the show?
On a more serious note, any of you guys having orphan Xmas in London? Just worried about Wagner being alone during Xmas & see sadness creeping in.I think being with some people, I think it be alright & Wagner self. I think the stress of stellarshit probably isnt helping.
Samir oh dear
What you up to?
"BIN RAIDER" (1st game) & "THE RISE OF THE BIN RAIDER"(2nd game). If you were to play one I would 1st one is better
Where is Samir? He alright?
Everyone was looking for him at work
I havent played it yet, I was too tied last night. You guys want to meet up tomorrow? I have to work today
Sounds good. Anyone want to book a table for roast tomorrow? Or should we meet later in the day?
You seen the new BayWatch trailer?
Man dont get too excited
Excited about roast dinner or baywatch?
Oh Ruby god
I guess after creating Ruby on wheels, everything must be quite basic in logic
Did you show your mum your pill face?
Just status report on Rubage's face
Yeah could be. Tell you how much profile your face is
Its just such a dump feature then again im not 16
Face profile fearure
Feature
How blippable, content whatever this profile thing is meant to do
Or means
Wanna do Scenario bar tomorrow 3ish?
Board games & beers
1+ if anyone else up for it? Samir oh dear? Stephine?
2+
Samir oh Dear Ruby combo will be interesting
Not sure if I can be bothered to order a roast anywhere tho
Yeah
You up for it?
4+ including myself
How the fuck that happen? Being chased by the cops
Scary to think that the driver could killed some people walking by
Ok Miss frog, Im going to running late as well 1st world problems trying to clean my flat keep seeing new things to clean. Will get there for 4pm, OK with & 
?
I mean Mrs Frog
Who is playing in the match? Only like watchinh when there is some riots

Sorry I have finish cleaning otherwise I never do. This is 1st day off in 2/3 weeks from interstaller crap
Im approx 100 steps away
Ok found a table down stairs
what time you getting here?
Come on sweet cheaks Ive been here for 25 mins playing Turok 2.
Memory lane with Turok. My memory is lying to me as this game was alot better back in the day
No worries, take your time.
At least Turok had some donkeys on it
Where are you Samir & Ruby?
Awesome stuff
Also its great because its not obvlious at all who it came from
Isnt she some BD woman? Probably will very confused by the present
Hopefully in a good way
Not sure yet, Friday - Xmas party. Sat - Hungover Sun - Stephanie Xmas. Next Monday? What's the earilest you can do? I have all next week off (Thank fuck)
Actually you sure you want to watch Star Wars? I will make Chewbarrca sounds throughout although he is not in it
Watch Star wars with me I mean
How good? Amazing good or come in one ear & pop out the other good
?
Star Wars is getting mixed reviews - love & hate relationship - 
IGN gave it 9.0
Oh Ruby God
Probably a highlight of his life of sales
People up for Star Wars on Monday? Hackney picturehouse? anyone else?
Ok what time you all want to go? 6pm for 2D or 9pm for 3D version. Im easy.
Not sure if I care enough about Andrei. Just added wood to fire so speak with forcing new features by sales & promising the client that it will out in 2 days
OK I've ordered seat F16 so I will sitting next to it 
So you dont want F17?
Do I smell?
Whatever crack addict
Wow 3 people are leaving this week. Fuck there will be no one left going at this rate
I wonder how long we been using Slackm? About 18 months? 240 people leaving over 18 months that is 13 people per month
Wowzers
So you reckon the numbers are higher because everyone doesnt get an account?
I hear rumours that they may closing down Turkey office next
They arent making much money anymore
Looks v.good although very normal for Nolan
Just looks like a solid WW2 film
So funny, been listening to Mikela to say how wonderful her secret santa was last year with business strategy book & dark chocolate. Cant wait to see her face with this years
Yeah indeedo or she lacks vision
I like the first point in this guide. Best guide ever
Looks pretty good although basically a posh kebab & its local. I wonder if you get served by donkeys?
Freeeedoommmm no more blipprape. Till at least 9th of Jan
Random words Rubage Club
Samir that is amazingly funny
I havent laughed out that loud in ages
Why Switzerland? Drugs legal?
It will be fine & dandy. Maybe we should turn up as storm troopers to demand them to service
Let me know you get to party. Not sure If I should get there early or fashionable late when someone is fucked
Everyone is fucked sorry
He is defo donkey slaver, I think we should free them by riding them rather been used as a jumper
We should do the crystal maze & ask if they would replace the crystal for a ruby
I hear its quite fun. Doing the maze I mean
doing your bday drinks this friday?
Cool :)
I want dato too. Reminds of patchblocks, got 2 of them & never around to using them
Who is this Steve Dann? Does he know what he is talking about or another big talker?
Titanfall 2 looks insane. Its coning PS4 right?
Sea of thieves looks like alot of fun. Attempted to get Xbone for that especeilly if have a crew
Ruby could be our Captain. Captaim Ruby
Quaternmaster Lion
Lol maybe he would make a great what they called on the front of the ship. Typically its a lion or mermaid. We could call the ship "the Sodeau"
Yeah i think you're right. Sorry Lions on front of a ship has been done to death & also abit of british empire
Unless that is what we are going as crew being British & all
Wow memory lane with hero quest video. I actually agree with alot of things he was saying. I played both warhammer quest & hero quest but hero was alot accessable
I remember spending hours creating my dungeons for warhammer quest coming up the enemy patterns, story, etc
Last played them when I was 16. Wow good old days
I liked the new god of war game
I liked the look of the god of war although its bizarrely inspired by last of us
Yeah indeedo although enjoyed the comic book like craziness of old ones which not many games dont do anymore
Not sure how I feel about Res evil 7, looks like every other indie horror game
Yeah. This is Capcom, not Hideo so i cant imagine the level of creative & inspiration, its going to be checklist copy & paste of other horror games which is always bad thing. Usually ends up being lacking
Sorry i mean "isnt always a bad thing."
Horizon Zero looks awesome. Like the theme of cave man future thing
Cool to see female lead too
I havent seen that yet
Pc Principle?
Nah I havent
:(
You talking about treehouse thing? Zelda looks awesome. Day 1 buy not sure if I get on wiiU or NX although Ive hardly played my WiiU
Like the RPG lite elementa
Elements sorry
I wonder what this NX is? I hope nintendo will have service model like PSN or Netflix
you fancy going to Neon Indian gig on Thursday?
Yeah their new album is pretty awesome. I think you enjoy it. But yeah its open invite if anyone else is more keen.
Hard to say. Each album sounds quite different
Only 3 albums & they all very good. Its all very 80s sync pop I guess
1st album is very 8bit & low fi. 2nd album is more emo & polished & well produced. 3rd is more blues & disco style
For accessablity I would say the 1st album which is called "Psyhic charms"
Info overload
Yeah 14
Yeah sure you can own me, no worries
Buy me 3 beers
Vegan beers
what time you about? Ruby is asking for your evil meals
Ruby says "will be within his ruby lair (home) soon & message you to declare some variables on your meals"
a message from myself, you bought neon indian ticket yet?
you getting a ticket?
Yeah I remember the days when tony games were awesome
Last good one was like at least 14 years ago now. Man I feel old
Chris - still want to see Neon? You want meet outside of Oval Space at 8.30pm? you want to meet us there or want to go after work?
Only got 2 tickets for myself & yourself :( There should be tickets left as Samir bought a ticket. You did right?
Is Sonia that Producer Twat? Apart of Allan's team?
Never spoken to her but looks twatty
Actually I have at Friday drinks once, yeah she is a twat
Is it me but most PMs at blippar are disillusional & useless?
Just have no idea how to add value
Just use buzzwords & have no idea what they mean
Allan is actually pretty good
very true
Because of that they can't scope anything which is why every product is late or crappy
Either late or crappy
Did you try bum him with Sam Strong moves?
I think you're believing what you want to believe. As ruby would say "there is no logic to your thought process, only feelings which arent valid"
Not sure if its clear but that's Ruby in Developer Variable declaration mode
Werid small world cause thats where my sister lives in super surubs village called Petts Wood near Bromley
The most exciting & progressive thing to happen to those parts would be a granny farting on the bus
For queen of hoxton tonight, do we need to buy a ticket to get in?
Oh I thought you're bday bash was tonight? Or is it next Friday? My brain is dead
Ok I'm going to need a disco nap before heading out tonight
Your bday so you can do what you want. Im sure there is place filled with rubies somewhere
Zelda bar
You dont want to go to The Zelda Bar?
My point is that sure that there is ruby related bar out there & Zelda bar would be cool. I forget that you need clear declaration
How do you know if it exists or not? Have a open mind. Ruby themed bars surely exist.
I thought skip those words as I thought you're apart of google genration. Who can connect the docs between silliness & actual real questions?
The joke is that surely a zelda bar wouldnt exist & just plain silly
I can see you are in developer mode
"I can see logic, humour & emotions arent allow as they are pointless enitities that can't solve problems"
Easy tiger Ruby, that hurt my feelings
I think you mean "words which I can't compile so they must not mean anything"
What devs dont realise "context" is everything with communication
Lol
Developer Zone would you having battle against another developer with tasks to create objects with best declartion of variables would create the object (get given) to attack other developer with. Early objects would start like apple, then become more useful object like "bat" as you progress which requires more variables
Things land? What is defination of things in your context? Lady Letture, Beer, evil meals?
I expect more declaration & precision from you
Lol
cba?
A boat party?
You guys fancy over to my place tomorrow 4ish? Some beers, food then a film or hit some vegan ruby pubs.
Im up for Monday with game of bones & football. Guys come over my place tomorrow & show you hamton. My address is: Flat 10, E5 9GB. its your destiny plus lots of vegans around here to get meal on.
Basically - My place today & Football tomorrow at Matts Or Rubys
What time you fancy coming over? My friend is Andy is coming for 3pm
Sorry what event you referening to? My place today or football tomorriw?
Yeah that is the plan. Games (if people come early enough) > Food > beer > Film
My friend andy is coming for 3pm usually play games till 6ish, get some food then watch a film
Anyone up for my place today?
Regarding hands database thing as PR stunt sure sounds good. For interior purposes for a computer to learn what hand is, it needs millions of images so getting people to provide photos of hands is pointless unless we want blipp bespoke to that person
Attempted by this John Carpenter gig in October, although it is pricey £35 with fees. Anyone up for it?
Just hope he doesnt have a heart attack in middle of gig
Sorry I didnt realise it sold out
Maybe just go & see if there is any tickets at the door or buy tickets from a random or ebay
You should love Bono. He is vegan isnt he? Or is that Beck? & probably loves rubies which is why he always africa helping them in their water so he can get them to mine him some rubies
I hope they arent blood diamonds
No sorry I need stop thinking you can connect & being lazy with declarations. I meant Bono to help africans with clean water & building wells that type of thing. Not get in it
What going to call the film? Mattius Lion Bone Ruby Chroncles
True maybe he sings them a song to inspire them to build wells "what a beatful well"
I think I would make a good villian, just mentally confuse them & bone them to death
Samir would be stragey (what person should be confused vs boned) whereas I be tactica
Tactics sorry
Never been to game tournament before. Although I'm not into this but I'm interested with passion and people watching, watched documentary on LoL champships and it's insane.
I would prefer to watch Street fighter champship but never in the UK
The champship in June in London is for Counter strike which is the middle ground, not super nerd but not that cool either
Yeah watched it on Netflix, it's crazy isn't it? How they have managers and win millions
I think you make it cool - Ruby!
Just need you say things like "variables declaration is a art". Women will chase down the street screaming your name "Ruby your variables are amazing!"
I see the trends. In hipster land, I certainly get more lettuce if I say "I'm make apps" rather "I maintain apps"
Yeah he has long fuck off name
Oh thank fuck, he has moved from QA tables
But I think Sam misses him
Oliver wants to speak you about your variables declaration and make you cry!
Anyone going to Dirk's leaving drinks tonight?
I used to work for company that made games like this. Advert gaming they call it to fund to their own games
BeefJack Studios
Peter does talk some serious shit!
Eu results how depressing :(
On a more postive note, Queen of Hoxton thing tonight do you need a ticket?
At least cameron cunt has resigned
True - what can do in 3 years anyway? Boris Parks?
He is more scary if gets more power
you might have to make a curry kebab for Farage if you want to stay here
Do you think there is a way to get him to change his party to "ILI" - "I LOVE IMPORTS" still very redneck at least it's more positive and less fear
APP - all people party
Sorry need to be more precise - change his idealogy for the name to change I mean
If he liked other nationalites, things would be different
Still remain redneck that is who he is but change the focus
Where you all go? Lion & Ruby
Same - where you going?
Anyone up for seeing sprinted away at 4pm today at hackney picturehouse. One of my fave studio ghibli films
Leon - dont know if I'm feeling up more drinking with gay pride today
Great night last night expect the minor dramas of socialpath skippy girl
Also made me angry & wanted say "Please fuck off back to Zo because no one wants you here"
She wanted Lion thats for sure. Trying to gimp him out to save us :P
No, Lion resisted. I thought he would take one for the team
Probably only wanted a roar
Anyone up for Sprinted away?
Actually I think just to play some games in pants today. Don't assed to left my flat. We should do a ghilbi night some time for sure
Weatherspooning it
Sodeu quote "Nice T & A!"
Was the other guy a skippy too? I didnt talk to her
I had a dream where there is a space program where they stuff humans within tiny rockets & shot into space. Any survivors from the process would be super humans who can breath in space & survival. Sort of like Spartans in 300. Werid random dream. Maybe all that talk about launching super liozers to mars triggered it.
the other night
Either just series of events but this program is create super humans. It was well tested repeatable process.
What timing! BJ lips
Yeah also the Vegan group is good one too. Ive met many of those around hackney
Careful with Lisa mate. She might show everyone
Change of topic. Been playing "Doom" its suprising awesome, nonpretentious shot in the hell out of things. Its a genius redone of the old ones. Anyone got it on PS4?
How far are in UC4?
Conditions of the deal: 
1.) No jacking off to my face
2.) No sharing outside Blippar
Share outside of Blippar is the condition. Sharing on here is fine
Fancy film night this week?
Sounds like you're on Acid already
Satursday doing a family thing but im free sunday
you up for the film night tonight? What time you want to start?
Developer logic - must keep food in your pockets at all times in case you get hungey.
Anyone up for hanging out tomorrow? I wouldnt mind going to scenerio bar to play some board games & roast dinner. Im up for other adventures.
Ok Im going to go Scenerio bar 3pm 100% tomorrow if anyone is up for it
Do they do roasts? If not there is plenty of places nearby that do
what about you? You about? fair enough, hopefully see ya later
Awesome sauce, yup its across from you. If we want roast may have go elsewhere but we go  back to play some board games later. Heads up, I have others meeting us there. Andy Pandy & Pieman
3pm yeah
You will meet them. They are my skool mates
Do some 5 player gamage
I think Ruby is coming later
Samir said he was up for it. Yet again up to you mate, unless you want to come later when they are awake. I keep things loose & open for those reasons & see what sticks if you know what I mean
Have a rough plan & see what happens
you're awake. Yeah at 3pm
I may be 10 mins late Im in the gym trying to become hulk hogan & failing
Just got off Dalston kingsland, be there in 5
We are still in scenerio bar playing king of tokyo if you wanna come?
She that bad?
Ruby - Im not racist, just progressive & celbrating cultures through streotypes
I think VR porn sounds awesomw
Awesome.Why do I need a GF? A lot cheaper & less hassle
On a more social note, would anyone be up for the citadel festivial on next Sunday in victoria Park? 
Also thinking of Lovebox on satursday to see only LCD soundsystem as they are awesome live
Awesome sauce! Chris you arent going to leave halfway through are you? Lol
does your cousin look like you? Another evil Samir that is interesting
Lol great so english :)
Anyone up film night this week?
Come to my place if you like
Yeah sure. I dont have many films unless I use Netflix. you wanna come & being your hard drive of movies?
You should of filmed it, could of been the next smash hit youtude video
Yeah i've seen it, dont mind seeing it again. Its been a while. I like Sweden
The new social movement "public doll bumping with wine"
Sam you taking apart on this new movement?
Please dont shot on her face thats disrespectful
Leon - You up for tomorrow? Roarrrrrr
So im dispointed that its not the lion king.
Or "the four lions"
So you up for it?
Ok i betta clean my flat
I dont remember that scene from lion king. Is from one of straight to video sequels?
Ä¹
Sorry Chris didnt see your message till now. World of blipprape
You guys up for another board games day at Scenerio bar on Sunday? Ruby is up for it
Howdy, just wondering who is up for board games tomorrow at scenerio bar?
If not I will plan something else you see
I liked Alien 3 which was made in 92
One year to go. The rate we going at it could become true. 2nd editiom will be poltician who failed the country
Femalists will start crying on this one
Maybe they should it change to Vegan busters, watch it then
The flatmate will have to:
1.) Know at least 3 programming lanuages
2.) Know of "No man sky" 
3.) Know difference between variables & god
4.) Dislike Vegans
5.) Like Donkeys
6.) Agree with everything I say because Im so logical
7.) No emotions because crying is boring
Emotion are useless
Lol
Its not posted yet
Nah needs 24 hours to approve
Lol
Otherwise you get lots of people like lawyers or wankers which you will never get on with
This way you will filter them out
There is some protest on Dalston
Freedom for Kebabs?
Anyone know what is it about?
Nothing as "No Vegans" or "No Kebabs"?
On the high street
You cant miss them or mishear them
Probably take 15 mins to reach your side of the street
How was neon demon?
Any neon in it?
Any demons in it?
Shade?
Sounds too middle class for me
I will throw shade at you in a min
I think you would get on Oliver
Get on with
As he loves Jermey
Too
Oh yeah
what you want me to say
Cool
Although you didnt answer my questions. Any neons? Ir any demons?
Maybe they only get a green card if they call themselves Simon
I really wanna play Pokemin Go
Its a system/features i was hoping Blippar would do but I think its the direction now
Geo location gaming
Yeah agreed
Yeah indeedo I think AR for Blippar isnt the thing anymore
Hopefully it will go full cirule & back go to AR
At least Pokemon Go proves that there is mainstream market for AE
AR
Was playing Doom. So awesome. I had to have a break its getting very intense
Like the old ones each toom has million fuckers
Yeah indeedo im impressed with Doom
Yeah lol typical doom level setup
Yeah indeedo, melee them for the goodies
Such a good meleeing a good fucker like barons of hell
I wonder if they do DLC for it for SP instead of MP
Yeah indeedo although you do get outgunned if you dont kill enough in the time
Also if run around too much you trigger other spawn points (more enemies). Very well designed
That is awesome
This is next gen gaming
Anyone up for film night? Fancy turbo kid which is better than mad max
Fancy watchig Turbo Kid I mean
Blanked
I hope so I would be turbo kid the 2nd & beat up you lions for your lack of  turbo & vision
Blanked again but I've won by default by the lack of response
That isn't comeback, you lose lame lion
That guy from kebab shop is amazing. What a tweeter; certainly sums it up well.
Referring to early comments. I think we should epic rap battle. Lame Lion Vs Chrisburster
Could do Ruby VS Evil Samir, etc
Whatever you're so lame, you can't ride a donkey
I think going to see LCD soundsystem on Satursday instead of Criteral festivial on Sunday. U up for it?
Matt (Greek warrior) what is mates rates to help us Device wonder project that Ruby told you about?
£65 per ticket - wowzers
Im still tempted
Thi
Tho
You could save from moving in Ruby flat aka space variables pad
I rephase "You could save that anount of money moving in with Ruby"
Criadel festial is £55 mmmmm descisions
Thats so next gen
Getting a ticket to Citadeal for £22, anyone want one?
Thanks chris for the heads up, good find :)
Whats format & Abdominal?
Got my ticket to the festivial, will get John Carpetter ticket when im at work.
in the office?
Cool setting it up now
Got John Carpenter ticket, anyone else going?
There you go Ruby
& anyone else - you fancy seeing neon wank on Satursday at 4.30pm showing or 9.30pm?
Lion - You such artisan tease - All that talk about 70mm vegan neon lit shots & no follow through, how could you?
Really? Melody gang bang. I thought you both had more class & honor than that. Bumping the enemy.
Blanked again
I can ask Chang to be our Rush Hour 5 film
Im sure he be up for it
Why? So you dont deny it? You & Samir did ride her like horse
she is going to what im Sunday?
Pokemon Go is down :( Boo woo
Werid the moon is out
I thought you developers love camera app, pushing your variablez
Is he favourite variable breaker? Achieved by travelling at great speeds0
Is it on stream?
Only games for windows crap?
I was tempted to get Xbone as you get 1TB one for £200 with bin raider I saw
I think they need the sales. Although not sure what was the future for it with this other console
I dont understand why Sony & MS are doing updates of their consoles already it defends the point getting a console just spliting up the userbase
Makes sense with phone as hardware is changing at rapid rate but consoles its all about OS like PSN & Xbox live as hardware evolution has slowed down like PCs. I remember back in 90's you had update once a year to latest games
My problem is that you get situcations where the developer spend most of their resources on the 4K version & normal version will get left unpolished. Spreading your butter too thinly. Like Blippar  supports iOS, Android, Wins desktop & WP 8 & 10. Thankfully they have ditched Wins. Anyway passionate rant over.
Xbone one S is just smaller?
Or does it anything else different?
So really £200 for Xbone one is a waste as it will xbox 360 soon
I think the problem with consoles currently it has werid flux between being as products vs service. With phones you don't mind upgrading as its apart of monthly contract. For monthly fee, you are getting data, etc things would pay for anyway. I wonder if they should do the same model with different packages. £30 per month, get one more games plus the new console when it comes out
Nah Mattius, these clubs are on the beach just walked by.
you're love this place there is so clubs here
I hope so too. I thought initally it was saying "It was OK to lead kids with Jazz" rather than sweets
Alot of likes
One for Lion & Beanie girl a also Dalston
Yeah its great, just what I need. Abit of sight seeing, nice weather, drinking cool beer all day & lots of fine people
Next time. Unless you wanna last min job, Im here till next Thursday
There is alot of meat talk in this thread, nice it mix up abit
Spainish are very passionate about fat people arent they? Probably some sort of god as they eat him olives & pouring oliver oil over him
James Olideu
I wonder if he could be a bodyguard? Bullets would just bounce off him
This is some Sodeau, I thought he is meant to be a spainish god/icon of fat
Sorry i mean "This is some serious Sodeau bashing"
That wasnt my intention
My intention was to prasie him as a god
Temple of Sodeau
Yeah indeedo
You probably type Sodeau than your own name. Im dispointed that doesn't auto appear with your real name: Rubage
Im not massive racist! You lack vision
Just come from Froggyland which contains 500 stuffed frogs reacting human scenes like count house or a school. Awesomely weird & orignal but also really crutel killing & stuffing 500 frogs. Its done by one dude in the early 20th century.
Really cool also really odd. Mixed feelings.
Court house sorry
I wanted to take more photos, there was no photo policy. I had to take withouy being spotted, felt very metal gear solid. Although clearly im no solid snake.
Maybe I should of taken out the guard out & take as many photos as I wanted
You dont think the latter wouldnt be a better skill to have like serect agent?
Armed siege?
Like a terrorist takeover?
What if the museum owner had info I needed for the mission & only got 24 hours to save the planet - Jack Bauer style?
Awesome comparsion. That desciption pretty much sums up my thoughts on Mad Max. Then again I think Im getting old, I cant handle 10 mini cuts in 3 seconds anymore.
You going to Paris? The heart of frogland?
You should speak with Charles as he is from Pariass isnt he?
Where you transfering to?
Omar & partying cant imagine that. This was honeymoon period for blippar when it was probably far less businessy
This is something you dig 
No worries. Not sure when/what to get tickets. Seems abit complex for my current state of mind
I mean to actually order them
Is better we all enter as indidvuals asking the sane amount of tickets to play the odds in our flavour?
Glad you could understand it. I can only handle BBB. Beaches, beer & boobs
& bubbies
Just enjoying my last days of holiday, back to real world on Friday to Blipprape :(
Although i am missing London, there is only so much beach, beer & boobs that man can take
For taking the guard out to take some photos of frogs?
I would blame it on my two solid evil twins: Solid bones & Solid Liqurd
Certainly would fit with the whole MGS universe. I lost count for how many clones/brothers solid snake has
Ruby Replicas
Im back in London, back to work today :( Anyone up for a movie night or board games at pub on sunday?
I might just buy it on PC stream instead as its small team. Probably take awhile for PS4 port. Ive met them at GDC & Gamecity, they are very clever & talented bunch. The way they make games is so interesting
I was watching trashy film - The Purge - Anarchy last night. I think you like it Ruby for its hollywood on the Rich killing the poor. Basically Labour vs the Tories The movie (american version).
Is it a recent film or 70's film?
When you going to Croatia? I have some Kuna money left from my holiday, I thought to give it to you as I wont use it. It will just sit around in my flat for years till I go again.
I keep hearing a baby cry for about a hour now. Just want to punch it in the face to shut it up.
Werent like Limp Bizkit? Apart of the whole nu-metal thing?
cant you claim job seekers as well as house rent allowance? Its not great but its something till land on your feet for hardcore gig
£75 per week plus house rent cover for £500 per month I think. That what I was claiming when I was freelancer 2.5 year ago before my blippar days. So probably more now especially if you say things like  "I love the Tories" or "I hate those poles" in a posh voice
Epic Gif
Huh? You speaking in Ruby again?
Oh sorry long day rubage
Awesome art & animation, shame about the subject matter :P
I only know him from "500 days of summer" which is probably one of the best guy love stories - not a girl flick.
Oh yeah he was dark knight rises too right?
I should add that to movie list for movie nights -  "500 days of summer" I mean
Bless!
You'e never bored working with me but I think I was too nutty & next gen for him
Fair point, that is deep :)
He was very reserved & self-conscious whereas I'm not either of those things as I just about getting the job done.
Yeah I did
They are taking after
Planet of the Vegans will happen
Vegan Squad isn't getting that good reviews :( I was planning to see it this weekend
Seems as lame as a Vegan
That's not hard although I haven't seen B VS S to SAY. Everyone told me that it was super pants
Might go to see "Neon Demon" instead
Although its only showing at the prince Charles cimera
Hates you too as you're have too much substance
nor vegan enough too
Out of seriousness, you want to see it again?
Ive also finished the device wonder script. I've written both Ruby & Lion to be in it. Would you both like to be in it & filmed? It will be very entertaining
Oh dear - Eyeball Book is a parody for facebook although I think I need to come up with better name for it
Thank you for your feedback, glad you all like it :) Lets film on Friday after beers. I will write myself in & Wagner & Samir. As we have two more scenes to go. Its still rough draft
Especailly the latter rules
Ok good advice Matt
Sam - Do you have your phone micphone we used before?
From an effects point of view, we can easily pull off the 50's black & white filter right?
Old footage look
Also how you feel intrographics for the rules? Which appear on screen?
Inside will be out on PS4 soon
Going back to device wonder film, so Ruby we should each have own version like "The Ruby cut" or "Samir oh dear cut"
?
Intereeting concept - Grind Blipps
Doing film night tonight plus we need Sam's micphone
Lets do filming Friday night
If that is cool for everyone else?
I'm not in the office to hear this townhall meeting. I wonder what is about?
Everyone has been a vegan to work at Blippar or they bought a new office?
you're in the office?
lol
Rish talking about him being 151st Pokemon?
The usual bollocks
?
so no announcement?
They wasted $50 million on building a office in MountainView
?
You guys up for this on sat night?
Lion and oh dear boy are going
Samir oh dear
I'm hoping it will catch on
Like Ruby or Lion which are of course like best nick names ever
He isn't evil, just makes you hear "Oh dear"
Well he claims he isn't evil which maybe makes him more evil. Just say "Oh dear Bless"
Does any have a dog bowl they bring in tomorrow for filming?
*anyone sorry
If not, marks & sparks will probably see dog bowls
NICOLAS RUBAGE
This is for a very important scene which you star in.
Shared you all 2nd draft of the script which I think is there now
Although I think rule 6 (final one) needs some more work as the set piece is abit simple
brainstorm session may needed for rule 6
lol
Thanks a lot :) Glad you dig it
The fun will start tomorrow
can you bring your mic?
Why is it so bad? Nothing like 300?
No vegans?
No hamsters?
Man of steel I thought was alright
Although action was boring but the origin story I enjoyed
So whats so bad? Sidenote: Never seen it but I dont want to either
Going to pop out & get dig bowl from Oxford Street. Lets start filming about 5ish or 6ish, when people are leaving. We want to focus on the art form of film making rather small talk "Wow you're making a film" 1000 times
from passerbys
No bowls at argos, heading Oxford Street
with bowl
Already had some twatty bankers offer to give 1 million bit coins for this bowl
Your evil twin is a banker
Playying frogger on london bridge too many twats
Ruby got some stage flight too
But acted well given the situcation of people walking into the scene
I have one of the worse hangovers Ive had for a while. You know when you feel like your brain in his goldfish bowl & bouncing around your head.
Everything is S L O W
where do you normally cycle around town? That is next gen. Cant you & Samir team up for the quest of ice cream?
This heat is up my street, this is what Croatia was like in the 30's. But probably not as much hotties
I actually said there is a rare subtance of Rubage only on Dalston you should come!
We are going to run out of vegs
I hope they never get algorithm right as i will end up bankrupt
Last night was really fun, we should do Dalston again. Maybe do this on Fridays instead
Yeah I think "The nest" or "The ablibi" are better but yeah it was odd so tunes were hardcore but no one was there, so small following
I enjoy how different each place was. Very random in a good way
Stranger Things is very good. Netflix has some very awesome shows
Thats the Dalston way, see what sticks but having 3 types of music on one night that probably the problem with getting people in
They dont need the money nor want us being there. Exclusive club zone for their money making schemes for nothing.
for doing nothing I mean
Just passing on the virus but not coming up with solution. System is flawed but no one wants to admit it
On a different subject, I highly recommend Netflix shows: Master of None, making a murderer, Narcos & Love
If course Stranger things
Have you seen the space donkey yet?
In stranger Things?
Wowzers - No mans pants is out tomorrow
I wanna play just name some planets like "Nicolas Rubage" Or "Ruby" or "Lion massive"
& see if you guys will find them
Try to meet each other & become a fleet of space pirates
I hate Sonic now, Sega has milked him to death. Hasnt been a good sonic game on years
I wasnt sure about Sonic going 3D. Never made a good transition like Mario. Although i did enjoy sonic adventure 1 & 2
Wow you are old skool that was like 1993
Last one for me was 2002
Last one I enjoyed & remembered at least
Remember playing Shadow which was one of worse games Ive ever played
Shadow was bad version of sonic with guns
Sega has tried to this many times before = epic fail
Just don't think they have the vision or talent to pull it off. Sega has become old catologue provider or RTS games company
Although alien isolation was great experiment for Sega to get back into AAA games
Yeah indeedo. Worked at CA back in the day, great company.
It shows how marketing always wins compaired to reviews. It has made $135 million - biggest August film weekend ever
$$$$$$
I doubt it will reach billions like LOTR or Star wars but still crap sells
Thats not the way to make films WB. Its amazing dark knight trilogy came from the same publisher. I Guess Christopher Nolan big enough name bring in $ so they have put their fingers in
I mean they dont have to put their fingers in
Imagine spending 2 years on film project & some producer monkey comes along re-edits your own film
I watched Hardcore Henry on Sunday. That was basically COD the movie in a good way, none of this serious stuff.
Ruby you need to come for your scene
This is your chance to become legend
Variablez
Anyone up for this? 
JP & Jaws - double bill
Next gen stuff :)
Its all coming together which feels good
Samir saying " that he is as smooth as a vegan"
Lol 20 shots of saying "nah nah nah"
That was a very good "nah nah nah" from myself I have to say.
Award worthy
Anyone playing no man's sky? Whats your thoughts so far? Seen any space donkeys yet?
Awesome stuff
you coming today/tonight for filming? Have you learnt your lines?
Thats the way of personal projects just to chip away at it over period of time unless you have time off to do it
Matt - Would a scene/footage log help with editing? Orignally myself, Sam & Samir were going to edit the footage before giving to you so you can focus on effects
Ok sure. We will do that
With Vegan point - I agree with Italian to a certain point as we humans our diet has meat in it. You just evolve & just become donkeys & live off carrots
When you're grown up, you can choose this diet for yourself
Recuiters piss me off
like estate agents I would love to them wipe off the planet
Does it freak them out enough to not email you again?
How annoying :(
I wonder if he tries to pimp out one of his flats whilst driving you around?
Or make you a blipp of your face?
I defo to watch more of his films like "Scanners" which was David's film before "Videodrone". I never was a big fan of "The Fly". Everytime I watch it, I find it a bit dispointing. Something about that film makes feel flat & dry, feeling nothing. Maybe too 80's. Every scene to push the plot along & predictable, not enough character development. Not sure why, I should really like it. :S
I dont have a clue unless he is a vegan
How many planets you named/discovered in NMS?
so far
Fuck! MS bought Yahoo? They are buying everyone, surely they run out of money by now.
LinkedIn was 25bn $ right?
I think party should actually be pirate themed. More fun rather a gentric networking event like last years summer party
Fair enough, just most people I spoke to just seemed more interested to bum up to a director rather letting loose & having fun. I guess thats going to happen at size of Blippar now
Whats free?
Rob stringer was stringing up all of the ladies. He isnt called stringer for nothing
Oh Ruby I'm begining to think your evolved nickname should be "Nicolas Cokeface"
That video essay is next gen. Great stuff, makes me want to watch the film
Any good - Deus Ex?
Yeah same at some points along with no vegan's sky. 1st world problems I have too many games to play which already own
Bin raider is awesome. I look forward for the new one. I like experimental games so NMS will be up my street & no doubt they release more mechanics (DLC) to improve the random element & scerenios that appear in the sandbox. These days, games like this are released Alphas. More of a service than a product which is one reasons Japanese developers stuggle to be revelent/impactful as were back in the day
Anywhere passion rant over
That is only AAA, let alone indie, casual & social gaming which Jap devs havent had success compaired the west. Just haven't explored this space as much/ havent adapted
They simply know where to the funds/resources to add most value. The problem with working on one game that long you see the whole picture, people spend on details which dont add much value to overall product/most players wont even notice. Its tricky balance because you dont have that passion the product will end up soulless which alot games that come big publishers end up like.
I recommend playing titanfall 2 demo. Most fun Ive had with a competitive shooter in years, although im not into mp shooter anymore
Worth checking as its quite different
Yeah it just fun & libearating. Reminds me of old shooters like Halo or Timesplitters. Werent balanced but you could be very creative in terms of how you played & felt good. Whereas shooters these days made for being e-sports which are very balanced & boring
Sam - You need my narrative lines audio tonight or you OK for me to send you the recordings tomorrow?
Manana?
Ok groovy
Yeah defo worth a watch
Is google drive working for anyone? I cant seem to edit any documents
I can open them but not edit them nor can I create new documents either. Wondering if it is in my end or just GD servers are down maybe?
Just any doc
In general
You having problems too?
Can you edit?
Maybe browser issue. I can edit firefox but not in Crome
Chrome sorry
Werid :S oh well
I dont know how to feeling about VR right now
Is a currently a gimmick or worth investing?
It is the future no doubt but when
£500 is a big investment
Sam & Did we record Ruby saying the line "Oh thats Dave, he been sitting for 3 months now." ?
We have one shot with myself trying to find "Dave". With one shot it may be worth a scene re-write/re-shoot. If we recorded two shots I wont change the recorded scenes & write different lines around thise shots
Will share script in the next 30 mins including fairy scene
Was it a good scene? Probably not right?
Lol Samir Oh Dear
Actually tempted to get Xbone one for this - 
I imagine this to be alot of fun
I think i will just get Xbone, as a super PC isnt worth it. Im more mac these days
uploaded the dialogue for the introduction scene
Thanks mate, uploaded scene 2 - Rule 1 (Nicolas Ruby's scene)
There is two lines recorded separately to edit them at different sections
" Please dont update OS. You should accept device for what it is. iPhone 4s is a classic phone." Line?
OK, let's do for the next filming session
Shall we do Tuesday? Ruby would be free for one more scene? It's beautiful scene. If not, I can write someone else to be in it?
That is bound to happen, let's reshot on Tuesday if people are up for it
That is next gen Dalston
uploaded dialogue for scenes 3 & 4 now
What about "Nicolas Rubage" acting career? That is one of the reasons why Leon leave the production as he was such a good actor, too much Ruby for him to handle
I've recorded and uploaded all of the Narrative lines now
Alternatively could re-shot Ruby's scene? When he isn't upset with his variable declaration
/not have a deadline
Did I say "Nicolas Rubage" or do I introduce myself as Nick Stone?
The problem with star & writer being in all scenes of a company introduction video is that suggusts that I'm only Star at Blippar which isnt true. You are all stars of Blippar & need to show n tell the company  especailly the impressable newbles from BD
How did the editing go yesterday? Any other reshoots or shots remaining to glue the scenes together?
No worries Matt :) That is the plan anyway, you would be do polish and final chop to make it magical with effects and stuff
My face feels raped
and my facebook
Those pictures were from my younger days
Why you using my face for your art pieces? Do I get a cut?
What presentation? Presentation of "How to ask a developer a logical question?"
Ruby vs Stone
The facts about the lead fairy
Would be cool if each person represented a planet & each team is a galaxy. Artsan Galaxy with the Lion planet "Leon", Cool T shirt planet "Des". You get the idea
To see it the galaxy you need to blipp a marker. AR galaxies
Or the wall could be physically have cut out planets like DIY style (arts & crafts)
I didnt realise there was record feature in there
Its pretty cool
Oh dear
Yeah indeed it is. Going back ideas, I think my ideas arent exactly mainstream for a public wall like wall of ham or whatever
Still at the pub?
Coming now
Ok coming
You with Rubage?
sam strong
Says one who calls by both names in CAPS
What pub?
Bu rivera now
With lots of tourists
Cant see you
Mullhorold drive number 1 really? It would be if I made a movie with Ruby, just random wanky scenes
Most of 100 films list I agree with tho
Turbo Kid is too Indie for BBC & super geeky/meta which probably why I dig so much
Jackie Brown was made in late 90s
The list is for 2000 & onwards
City of god is one of my faves, amazing film
Blame the fact that simply people dont have any taste, just like shit
& vegans
Sounds like a real dick
Is this actually his day job/living? I should do this
Make werid videos & make indie games & writing self improvement books about "ham" I be $$$$$$
Are you still there? On my way
With Lion
You now see Rubies everywhere
I dont have any ideas for project wall to be honest right now
If I could involve Ham & Vegans somehow that would be inspiring
Leon where you go?
Did the lion sweater scare you the much?
Was just watched Flash Gordon with Lion. I thought It was pretty flash & shiney. Only critisic is that there was no vegans in it. Flying dudes vs Vegans would make amazing sequel
I was probably distracted by shineness & boobs to notice 2bh
To change the topic. Do you think Lion should buy this? 
I think it would reflect his inner Lion
Its actually dispointing that I havent found Ruby shirt yet.
I dont think he needs to point out his lion. It would allow him to unleash the lion visually like ming with his shiny red costume
Sure yeah allow him unleash his villainness
Such space opera, love it :)
How strings that guy has on his bass? Techinical impressive but I dont know if it was creativity/musicial impressive if you what I know. They arent no Pink Floyd or Beatles
The word "Impressive" is open/subjective word like "good" or "nice". Which isn't does mean much by itself when referencing to something when you have no context. Its like saying "I had a nice sandwich". Was it nice because it was made by my friend or did it taste nice? If it was nice why was it nice? Etc
Impressed by how or what? Impressed by the vegans? I hope you dont give your feedback like this. "Hi Leon, what you think of this style?" Lion reply: "Lovely Grrrawww" then you walk off
You're Darth Vadar
Think of Episode 5
Not impressed by than huh?
Who is Stepanie? Joris's GF?
I bet she is a vegan
Does she grow carrots from her ears?
Nah sorry need some me time tonight
How many pictures you have of me? I can ask for copyright of my face. Show me the money. Vegan Doner thats a new one. That is so Shoreditch isnt it?
Any of guys into playing tennis? Just discovered some free tennis courts (dont have to pay). Would only need balls & rackets. Could a weekly session of doubles, losing team will get shame Gifed (create a Gif of their shame).
So would like to see Ruby doing a logic fit gifed
Nicolas Ruby
Into Tennis?
Also. Not quite Leon. Its my nephew's book & he is only 6.
I didnt know you produce eyes
Eggs sorry
Or stand for quality eggs
Say where?
What my parents are chicken eggs?
Im missing something here
Watching Preacher, pretty good TV show
You loser child. Wait for me to type you some nonsense
NICOLAS RUBY NAH SAYER FOR NO MARIO KART COSTUMES WHILST GO KARTING
What is this inventor guy doing at Blippar? What is he inventing?
Anyone up for a beer tonight?
Nah sorry I only wanted a quickie. Brixton is more of weekend trip. We should arrange a time to do some editting on Device magic video. When you free for this?
No worries, meeting up with Lion in Dalston
Copy & paste it in. What it say?
Camera wars
My face has been raped again :(
Oh dear Lion. You have just started a war with the Vegans
Making A Murder is great. Such a fucked up state of affairs story although I do wonder if they bend the truth abit to frame a message
I guess thats a problem with documenarys in general
I'm not talking spefics of the story itself just general tone of story/message they are telling
Its very well editted & written. Amazing they collected all of the footage & made colherece narrative out of it because its very complex
I can see why it won awards
Indeedo :)
I recommend "Narcos" or "Master of None" very different but just as awesome as making a murderer
Interesting facts :) I worked at NASA & they didnt agree with my pitch to send tigers & Lion to another planet to make the perfect space animal. 1.) To proof that animals like us, can live & survive on another planet 2.) To make super species in the pricess 3.) If we need a super weapon to take back earth, we can use the litigers
I think at some point, humans will have to live another planet as we use up most of main resouces on earth. Like Gundam, humans from earth & humans from Mars will fight over resources from each planets. Or Aliens to take one the planets forcing share of resources which isnt favourable for rich & greedy
I never come up with things randomly altho they may sound  random for comedy value. My ideas do have lots of elements to them leading to conclusion or idea to begin with.
Nah I havent followed the past 12 months. Forget "The pants down" & watch Narcos
The low down sounds like a bad porno
Howdy what time shall we meet at loading bar today? 2pm sound good? Or that too early?
Whats are everyone else thoughts on this matter of meetage timeage?
Sam Strongage is confirmed his soon arrival & Stephage may come.
Yeah it is nice in the Jolly Butcher. Could go for Roastage there although it will busy.
Are you coming Beanie head?
Benedetta
The loading bar is very quiet so no need to book
I dont think you're ready Ruby. You barely cope with normal general conversation from myself, I was quite impressed on Friday. We have progressed
Story war we play is more accessable verision of D&D. Well sort of
We were sharing boolan conversations we not quite ready boolean expressions quite yet
Sorry what you talking about? A card/character from story war game?
Found table downstairs
Smells of geek tho
Here is some info on Medusa 
With logical googling process to story waring
God of war - 
I have all wank materal I need
Does photos of you help you to achieve your poo?
That is amazing. The best trolling/griefing ever, I liked how you used my photos of me randomly in there. No wonder he was confused
I have linkedIn invite from his so called account using my face
Yeah I agree, Brian came across abit "I feel bad for not remembering you so I going to flipp back at you" Did you know that he react like that? Was it abit of dick when you knew him?
I have to say it was trolling masterpiece
So you thought troll him anyway? You didnt know that he would fall into your trap
As you dont know him really
Anyone for going to copenhagen in October? It will be cold but I hear it's awesome city!
Do you not like my photos of you across the office?
Not stalker like all
I mean "Not stalker like at all"
No Spolters
Please
Up for film night Wednesday this week?
To watch "The raid 2" or "Midnight Special" or "Her"
I have a quite few projects currently: 1.) Device Blipp including Chris Jones the movie. 2.) Robot body the game
3.) Learning the JS
So I happy to sing but you need write the music
Rubyeye
Would be a good theme like a James Bond film
"Rubyeye!.....He declared his varables through his eyes and makes people fall to their knees using logic ....RubyEye!
Dude I need a haircut
Sam you didn't rape my face with snapchat, well done :)
My shoes are major giveaway too loud
You got me
I wondered where you went?
Its my shoes that give me away
you up for the film club tomorrow?
Wanna go to my place
I still should stick to day job not singing
I rephase I think i should stick to my day job not start singing
Fair enough. You make it sound like you oiling a car or something. Everyone needs some love. Ok I will clean my flat anyway so there be no dirty wank pants on floor or anything. Let us know tomorrow
Is that a real tweet? I hope so :)
Got a idea for the blippar wall thing
Went to moo.com offices last night for networking event. This was their wall. Looks very homely & family like.
Could do something simlair? Like you have to create 3D model of yourself or bring in a baby photo?
Just need a frame for each peraon
Person sorry
I getting raped. Why is everyone taking photos of me? Im not that attactive. You should pictures of Rubyeye instead
I remember trying to get into Armoured core which was most hardcore mech game
I had that mech game with 120 button controller too on xbox
You had to reject to live if you died inside the mech you need to restart the whole game again
Yeah same although I sold mine for something silly like £250. Helped me afford a flat (very small step but a step nevertheless)
It was great game
I wish got into armoured core. same developers as dark souls, they are very unique dev studio
In a position in the business for appealing to hardcore gamers
Normally there is no money space but they seem to pull it off
I think that is fair & just question
I hate to you to break it to you but "no" but we all love you the same of you are. On a side note, left my bum out of it
This is getting abit werid
This is boring work related question - Does anyone if there is a way to make a copy of a whole folder in Google drive?
If you have Folder A with 3 folders in it, one file each for an example. Copy Folder A to create Folder B and it will same folder structures and files included
Yeah it works. Ended up using external spreadsheet which someone has created a script to do this
Probably in the long term, create my script to do this myself as I will copying alot of folders
Thanks for the link
ROARRRRRRR! You up for the film club? Samir Oh Dear and Rubage are up for it...... Aren't you both?
Mario been annonced for new iPhone
or OS 10 anyway
Nintendo is going in roll in the money and the bitches $$$$$$
Yeah its endless runner game as if there aren't enough of those on the app store already
We are in "the cross keys" pub
Weatherspoons towards liverpool street
Its actually odd wanky in a good way for a WS pub
He probably loves you & wants a feel of a ruby
I think you should go after him, not me
He might be a french Indy Jones "It becomes in museum" rather the hands of super villian "RubyEyes"
They probably trying to get people buy higher quality music via their i-tunes too. They win at every angle but I think its interesting feature for the future, just wished focused on wireless charging/bigger battery as that is problem worth solving right now. Just seems wireless headphones port isnt really problem worth solving yet
Ruby nappy hat time
Certain very diverse & different for Wheatley thats for sure.
Not sure it reminds of a film called Shoot em up which was very enjoyable & silly action film with clive owen who killed people with throwing carrots
Not sure why i mean
Clive Owen was a great films in the mid 00s
Children of Men
Thats next gen
Just doing my weekly chores - duty calls. Anyone know of a barber open on sunday? Need to sort out my wig
Im up for a games bash later if anyone is up for that? Beer on the bacony with some mp games
where you end up going? To french town?
Want to go Clapton?
Plenty of pub gardens herw
Here
Its changed name recently to "The Vegan Hart"
According to Ruby I bet
Hackney Central could a good compromise?
Its in the between Shadwell, Dalston & Clapton
Where do you all want to go in Dalston?
Shacklewell Arms?
The thread is a zone of pure confusion & randomise, I don't understand what been said on half of the time anyway. I go along with it, whatevers
Nice?
What's nice?#
Vegans are nice
Beers are nice
Grannies are nice
Im going to give it a miss. Im pretty tired, done alot today
Thanks for the invite/offer but nah, Im wiped. Need to ready up for a week of blipprape
Sorry :(
I can't imagine the child you would produce a "Tizzle oh Dear" what a animal that be
What is interstellar? A new word for project storm?
Lion propaganda - 
When will Blippar learn? Not to do 8 things at once
Interstellar will be rubbish because they doing too much over such small amount of time
I think I have a fair point
You design and build in iteration (stages) not all at once
Sound effects are amazing
I want to join cult
STD sexual transited Demon
Thats next gen
Oh I didn't realise this was still on. Im located in Harrow (in subs of north west London) so take me a while to get back to the land of east. Whats the plan & time you staying out till?
Films at Samir's place or films at cinerma?
Im up for Hateful tomorrow night, I will book the ticket tonight when I get home. I message you guys later when im back in the land of the east today, hopefully meet up later
Hateful 8 tonight or tomorrow night?
Ok. Its taken me ages to get back to east from Harrow (its like I've come from another land) so I've headed home. Sorry see you tomorrow for the movie
I didnt see your message till now, yeah all booked :)
Anyone up for this Terry Gilliam talk -  May be abit high brow for a sunday but Terry is awesome :)
wank bank time
Do you get to shot vegans or any form of ham? Otherwise nah as bored I've killing solders that apart of the system used as pawns or killing average joes
For shooting vegans?
I got headset & yeah Im up any  mp or co-op gamage although I wonder if there is vegan or ham game out there?
that sounds amazing, I must buy that game
I believe Oscar is leaving :( Epic fail
I have no one to talk to for my late nights in the office
Wow I give her a bone
Oh yeah she has a sense of humour which is rare for a lady if it is a she in fact
Is masters on netflix? Masters is super guilty pleasure
Like Ruby says crap but genius for all wrong reasons
Whats the picture quality like? In HD? I wanna see He-man in full 1080p
See those muscles as every man should be like him
Oh Ruby you're loving it really ;)
Bring your mum along & we can tell her some stories
I would like to meet mummy Ruby
Where you thinking of going Nandos in Dalston?
Nandos is quite un-hipster for Dalston, not very post-vegan
Nah its not yet, I think it will be released on Tuesday :(
Oldman is great & plus Simon Chang is in it too
Im up for movie night
I haven't seen snowpiecer yet - any good?
That the film is one about a super train which goes around the planet
Sounds like a post-vegan
My mum is the same, easily culture shocked.
I love how your movie is sign max wars, who is James?
From the war of the worlds
Wow WTF what a trailer
Its Art
What deserves a fuck you buddy? Sorry maybe Im special :S
No I never that side of him, just insightful pearls of wisdom grandad thing he does
Where's skater video?
If you did you would become a true pimp then all you need is some bitches
& a pet gimp
WTF you guys meet some werid ass people. I thought I was Werid with my ham love
I have many evil twins like yourself with nicloas Ruby
Bummer I would be up for the Relvent & seeing in Hackney Picturehouse as I only live down the road but I got plans tonight. You guys doing anything tomorrow?
& Leon - actually I can come for the film, what row you sitting?
What time you getting thrre?
Ham guts it looks ;)
Were you the revenant inspired watching animal stayage/wearage?
Anyone up for some HellDivers tonight? Free twin stick shooter on PS4 I hear its awesome co-op game
Any of you play clash of clans & want to join my clan called *hamclan*?
How much BS did he talk? Or was it informive & inspiring for young uns?
Which farcry? Farcey 4?
Anyone have Destiny here? Or GTA5?
I have towerfall ascension which is awesome 2D action pixel game either co-op or MP
Oh really? Its great ain''t?
Bummer :( Been thinking of getting Starwhal which is sale at the monment on PSN which is meant really fun mp game
I like the idea of the hamathon
Just bought Starwhal, only £4
The seed that created a wave of inspiration
Howdy, I highly recommend Starwhal, It's one of best easy to pick up & play & fucked out of my face (after the pub) MP game I've played in ages. Me & some of school friends were playing it till 5am last night,  its pretty awesome!
What is on Sat?
Sexy times
Oh Ruby I thought you loved the griefage ham stealing
More like Hamye Waste :p
Actually that book is good idea looks like a good money roller, I bet it brings in £££. Lots of chucks love this type of thing
Chicks sorry
Not chucks, they probably love it too
Rubage - You should write a book - DIY games dev - how to make a game with fuck all budget
I bet lots of indie devs buy that
What a anti bone! This week can't get any worse
The only film I liked him was Bromson he actually acted really well, good character study.
Well directed but the director clearly loves himself with awkward 10 mins shots, only kubrick is allowed to that
Yeah whilst jacking himself off
Only God Forgives was painfully wank although I digged the music & the mood
Im going to play driving hell from home tonight in my pants
I can setup a web cam if you want
When you playing? Im still recovering from other night, it was hardcore for a wednesday
Ruby griefer
Hope that BBQ is good
Thats quite next gen
Rubage - wanna play helldivers?
It says something about NAT type not the same so I can'y hear you guys - epic fail :(
Change your party settings to audio chat to "proritise Game Chat" then we chat in the game rather the chat room
Restart your console maybe
I'm creating a game so maybe join my game instead
I know the network code for this game is balls as we had problems before
Oh maybe
Seems odd that they divde their fans between the free loaders & the payers but probably not been QAed, :S
How you do that?
no download for me today for hell drippers
How was your two dips Ruby?
Try joining my game as Lion couldn't hoin yours but maybe he join.my game
Ive got my console to auto update games
Oh really?
I can't see anyone game anymore
This is old 90's games using 48k
Yeah its great fun, shame about the network code
Epic fail - just says "teleport failed" for ruby & Leon
Syning save data
the waste guys
shall we all reset the game?
Ruby you joining?
Indeedo it was. Epic fights for humunity. Next time, you guys around tonight for gamage?
Maybe get others games - Rayman Legends, StarWhal, Borderlands
too to avoid the connection rage
We need invent a app for compairing games lists so you can see what games people have
Whats the rules for the club world? Thats a "zone" is that a club?
Give me about a hour, trying to solve a huge 1st world problem with where to hang my pictures in flat for perfect combo
I would like to but I have my family coming around. 1 of my sisters hasn't seen my flat yet :( Next time. Where is Bishops Gate? Shoreditch?
I wanna meet this kid
quite trashy for the indie
trashy in a good way
Just finished watching "What we do in the shadows" the best comedy I've seen in ages
What spoons pub is it? Whats it called? I will for one drink
Bad english - sorry which pub you at? Im outside in the wild now
I dont know maybe
I havent seen the samir for a while, you coming ?
I dont know which pub tho
No whats it called?
Lion mentioned Tower Bridge
Leon
Ok on.my way now
oh rubage
fair enough
Wheres samir these days?
sounds very german in a good way
Could you get me a ticket too?
Im up for some raving on Friday
Cheers big ears
Oh dear no worries, get well mate
Or a wank
wank = rest
I can't tonight I have to do some food shopping - epic fail :( Would be up for Friday night or Sunday? Do one on one of those days?
Maybe wankage is the cure tho. I wonder if there is zombie porn (good excuse/set piece for porno) where they hump themselves back to human?
Yeah sunday is film day for me
What if Human humps a zombie, when they become a zombie again? Or would only zombie on zombie action = humanage? Theres too many possibilities
"What do you do synergy levels would be for niche verticals such as Zombie boneage?"
Great minds think I like
Great ideas require great experiments. So I think Ruby you should try to wank yourself to a oblivion & see if you feel better
& think of tom cruise
Sorry maybe I went too far, I didn't think my idea was that progression
Just a wank will do
Is that case where some dude eaten up another dude? the guy was eaten signed a contract saying "Its ok to eat me"
Thats next gen, pushing boundries
What channel is this?
Thats next gen fuck you if I even seen one
Clem is a dick so its well deserved
What did you say Samir on slack? I dont have access to that channel :(
What was the comment?
No access to Dev slack channel :(
Awesome comment
lol hehe
Nah you yeah?
cheers big ears
Amazing randomise
I like how there is hat QA
Don't blame me that you can't cope with freedom of the ham revolution, opening your doors to so many possibilies
Yeah New ps plus games are great I look forward to playing them
Theres uncharted 4 beta you all should download too we can play mp just this weekend
Uncharted 4 is in 2 month time so get a taster before its out
Yeah recogision is better, Tech at Blippar is poo compaired to our rivals but Blippar is marketing company not a tech/creative compsny
GB looks pants but probably make lots of $$$
looks like the Skippies have gone something right than BBQ & surfing
No man Sky looks awesome
Its most interesting concept for a game I've seen for a while
Huh sorry
Leon should design aprroval seal logo like nintendo's
I would but Im on a mission to become Hulk hogan tonight with pumping some iron
Maybe should be called Hulk Ham
Do you any of guys pump any Iron? In english, do you go to the gym?
you're gym name could be "Mattius the greek" sounds very epic
god like
I bet you sit there waiting for a CJ feedback
Nicolas Ruby sounds pretty greek already
Matlas I like :)
Christopher - Saint of travels
it means
Sony will show them the money to make a VR game for sure
Easy tiger ragey ruby
Ragey Rubage
No man Sky gets a wank edition as well 
Never a big fan of these editions for games. Always seem abit of con
I told you Rubage Im gyming sweet cheaks
Im pumping Iron unless you want to come to watch? Become apart of hulk ham fan club
Why? She fell love with you
at 1st sight or she thinks you built a space station for your evil empite?
Did you go evil samir on her?
Evil Samir
Ham Juice
Sony will show them the money to ensure its solid with VR late on
I wouldn't be suprised if Sony is publishing it being on E3 stage last year
No doubt there will be lots of DLC. I hope they aren't sony themed planets like Uncharted, Twisted metal planet, etc
Yeah I think you're Right mr lion
Im up for that
I hope it isn't just tech demo of random crap you do without any conquences or context
Thats the problems with games with too much freedom
Fair enough :) I guess its down what type of gamer type you are? They say you're play games to fulfill a role of: Social lite, Completist, explorer (plays for experience) Elite (you want to the best). They say if you want your game to become msinstream you have elements which will please all these type of gamers
I guess it interesting to see if they have such elements or is just for a explorer gamers
Yeh indeedo completist will stuggle for sure
Also I wonder if you are all playing in the same universe so we can meet each other
Pretty much
Next gen!
Broforce is fun. Did you figure out how to invite people to your hosted games? It's been Hipster fave on pc for a while
You should start giving Sodeau royalties
I see! Yeah he wouldn't need to talk synergy powers of UX but what else would he give the world? Be like a typical washed up actor or writer in LA
He should open it in SF
What sort of time you guys thinking going to the doctors order rave? If it's late one, probably to have a disco nap before as I'm getting old
you're quite near Hoxton right? One bus down Kingsland road
Indeed I did. Who else is coming to Jungle?
I can ask around if no one wants come from Blippar massive
Blippar da solid crew
All we need is another 6 to become da solid crew or could be blippknot? They had 6 members or did they have more than that?
Could wear a marker as a mask & say "blipp my face Bitch"
Sorry Rubage I dial it back to PG rating for your eyes
Or 15
Nicolas Ruby
Good thing Chang is leaving then saying I'm going to be only QA at this rate
You pretty much summed it up there's a lot of rage
Nicolas Ruby
Nicolas Ruby
Nicolas Ruby
Whatever? That's his name now
I think I need disco power nap
What time you heading out? Want to a pub before go to the club?
Not sure actually I hope not I hate 50 cent
Going to get some food & head out. What time shall I get to yours? Where you live? Or we shall we somewhere else?
Only 30 min walk, not bad at all
I think you guys invent your own language
should invent
E
V
I
L
R
U
B
Y
L
I
O
N
Sounds like a good name for a band. You shoukd form one
Awesome night & awesome moves should do that again
:)
My head is so fucked
Still in bed, need get up
Yeah Leon unleashed his inner lion with his smooth moves, Samir unleashed his evil by slapping some ass although I think they liked it. Ruby just declared some more variables
It took me 10 min to write that
Yeah that's what I'm doing. All that talk about LA, made me wanna watch Street Kings
Lol same :)
It's on Netflix
Typical bend cops drama in LA story - I prefer training day with Denzel
Has anyone "John Wick"? I hear that it entertaining turn your brain off action film
House of card is hard to watch full stop it doesn't spoon feed you at all
So it's worth a watch?
Should do blippar voice over for max, quite easy as there isn't much talking
Yeah interesting watching it that way probably enjoyed more than with sound
Going wait for reviews/hype to calm down as every recent AAA Ubisoft game recently has been all hype but boring like ass creed Hackney, Far Cry cow hunter, splinter cell 15.
That's next gen dating. I dig it
Better than all profile writing bollocks
Shall we start kickstarter to get £5k funds to fund James Sodeau shouting for funding for another project? Funding within funding
I'm still recovering from Saturday
Is that the unity editor?
& say "sort out bloody smoke & mirror data which actually makes sense with Variables"
Then a dragon punch & say "Fanguken"
Rubage
Just then I thought you wrote "portal meets ham man". Now that would be a game :) Hams through portals
Sorry I had to go home & get some sleep. One of those Blippar rape days & plus I have minor ruby flu
NICOLAS RUBY
Easy tiger, sweetcheeks! Yes shall I remember that for next time with   my variables
Anyone doing anyting tomorrow night?
Variable: Fun
Evil film?
Or Lion Film?
Anyone up for a beer later? I have to work late
Usual Blipp Rape
Dude Did I upset everyone?
How s3xy
Galak-Z is awesome & I bet your dad is too
I like how it looks like 80's anime
Hub is great too with lighting elements when you're firing
Great effect filter
Blur filter thing
Cheese shit
I call it
Well french would agree that cheese is beautiful
VARIABLE: I CAN'T READ BETWEEN THE LINES I NEED STRUCTURE & FOLLOW LOGICAL RULES OF THE UNIVERSE
There's enough anti-COD crowd to find audience I would of thought. Pretty mainstream game theme it's not like its features zombie porn with pink unicorns
I think it been love/hate affair
EDGE 10/10 Gamesmaster 2/10
Indeedo
COD crowd are called "Bro gamers" - Buy every year COD, Ass creed & sports game Fifa or Madden if your game fits in that group $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Chris Bones wouldn't play games. too into pussy & cheese being French & all.
What would Nicholas Ruby play? My little pony?
I'm referring to your evil twin Ruby or maybe good twin
you asking about the Chris Bones bit? Pussy & Cheese bit? Or Nick on PSN?
watching kill list currently, I thought chat on for abit of calm down its intense
I mean "I thought chat on here for a bit to calm down as the film is intense"
But you not French so you wouldn't
You probably more kebab, beer & Lettuce (fine pussy)
Guy
Gentleman. What does that consist of in 21st century? Abit of dying term these days, holding doors open, giving a lady a good wink & say "alright darling!"
It's good film so far although intense
Calling a lady "darling" not being a gentleman? What about "Diamond"? That more gentlemanly?
Easy tiger! "Diamonds" are nice
Like "Ruby"
Sorry family duty today in Beckenham land (I hate Bromley)
:(
I'm up for "the Vegan" tomorrow (21st century  version of a witch?
Sexy combo
Take some photos will ya?
Was that was from stokey bears?
They do good burgers on stoke Newington high street
Yeah plus I like the bear theme
Never been to loaded before. That in Dalston?
Tones want to ban milkshakes at school?
Tories
I love the surprise for season 2 - awesome stuff
Trying not to reveal any spoilers
Really? Not sure like the whole restart thing it's like Bloodborne
Game play,  story & visuals are great
I don't think ideas carry on from season to season you have to buy them again but you use your crash coins (whatever they are called) to sell for more currency
It's a bit of odd trade off
Yeah indeedo - how far you got into season 2? On a different note, what time we seeing "the witch"?
Want to get dinner before & after? I have no food at home :(
Other than beans - could be smelly film experience? I guess that 4D experience as I would thought 16 century witch would smell of fart
The Imposter is so fucked up, interesting watch
Howdy Samir, no worries I will order my ticket now
Ordered my ticket on seat E7 sitting next to you.
Want to meet earlier before to get some food?
Olso does good food although it's very hipster like crab burgers
Or walk up towards Clapton there's lot of good places
Sam wise elf
Just walking through Hackney Wick -I forgotten  how it's such nice Sunday place, we should come here sometime I love it as lots of skaters & art galleries in warehouses.
you may like it, may broaden your variables
Sorry just read the thread now, maybe next Sunday if you're up for it
Grab a bike?
Oh yes of course. Ruby just order it, you know you want to
"The Vegan" will broaden your variables
So are you ordering a ticket?
I haven't provide an answer yet you said "Chris Jones" you're breaking your own array of "yes" or "no"
I'm broading your knowledge already & haven't started watching the film yet
I'm in Stratford now, getting some euros & 3ds games for holidays in Lisbon. Shall we meet for 6 for food before film? I going to pop home to clean up before then
Fair point batman
You wanna meet in Olso which is next to Hackney Central station at 6? Plus it's filled with elfs & Vegans to keep both Samir & Sam happy
You dig elves cause you are one unless you're giant. I thought Samir be in Vegan types but may be into elfs too
Did that compile with your logic?
That's annoying :( You don't realise how awesome our system is till something breaks, I remember living in a house for a week with no electricity in my student days. Man I love electric, you can't do anything without it
Hope you have water soon
OK I going to leave now probably take 15/20 mins walk for you, if walk towards hackney downs park
See ya roughly in 20
OK see ya there soon
Olso which is next to Hackney Central station
OK I'm here now you nearby?
Oh Sam,  you're going to miss out on all female elvies
And plenty of elvies here
"The Witch" was great, certainly wasn't for vegans nor could remake the modern take of "The Vegan"
Hopefully be £300 here instead £600
It's interested to see possibilities, I can a lot of fun games if you have mulit players with 1 headset - recreate knightmare you remember that show?
Other players could give directions to the player using VR headset
Always thought concept of where each player would a unique sense/thing they see that others couldn't. One player could see blue, other can see red or one player can hear certain sounds. Thought be interesting co-op adstart art puzzle game
Yeah it's exciting stuff
Thanks for votes of confidence.
We should :) I used to do a lot of level design
Rubal
I'm up for that
Next gen photoshopping
Good stuff
What is the plan for film club tonight?
Any donkeys or strippers?
I'm working my home today, let me know when you leave the Spoons. Meet you at the host's house
Who is the host for film night?
I'm up for it. Where we going?
I think I will leave it tonight as I have too much work to do plus I'm raging
you guys up for Dan Deacon gig tomorrow night? At village underground in Shoreditch (Ruby's favourite place)
Rage
Blippar Rape
Too many problems & not enough guns to shot them down
Politics surrounding with Chang leaving is the problem
Anyway boring
Talk about it some other time. Up for gig?
May pop for drink tomorrow then go to gig
Shame you can't come Rubage
Anyone else want to go & see Dan Deacon? Ruby's ticket Great :)
Is matt coming to the pub?
Is actually a person or some AI?
I meant that I haven't him in a while
Actually just realised I only got 2 tickets but you could buy a ticket at the door no doubt if you want to come?
Cool
We should meet before the film for food/drink . Anyone up for some Gamage tonight?
Where you thinking of going for the roast?
Bummer, I dont know anyone who be free tonight to take you your spare ticket.
Are we all meeting at Olso again at 6pm by Hackney Central?
In terms of roast dinner never had it at Olso or could go elsewhere for food?
you wanna meet at 6.30 at Olso
?
OK I'm leaving now
What time will everyone else get to Olso?
Any of you up for clover field tonight to take advance of film Mondays or you need more time to take in & process the craziness of "high rise"?
Good point
When they showing it?
Could see Clover field at Richmix cinema in Shoreditch at 8.40 Wednesday? It's easy for everyone to get too.
Easy to get home I mean & also pro - vegan for Ruby
Yeah I need someone grab when I'm scared during a scary one. Also hugged Leon during "The Witch"
Same as Ruby I need see how tomorrow goes as I have 4 interviews which is balls
I hate recruitment
- Yeah it didn't fit into your variables,  you need to re-write your wash code
Milo is too green to do anything other than placing bugs in a database
That plenty much sums it up
I actually spend a lot of time with him schooling him, but just doesn't value or understand it. Too young
Just wants to write bugs
BDD, TDD, test case writing & management, How to plan what testing you should do,  testing methods, etc There is a lot to QA despite common believe as I think  Phil thinks we smashes buttons
I don't see it as mistakes per say as you can't see the output of your code within large of system with many commits from different people's written code
If you placed your wash code with Phil'd stick fingers code what do you think would happen?
Or does licks produce more sauce ?
You sick puppiez
Easy tiger sweet cheeks said I never said finger the Milo, you getting all artisan with my words
WTF? Why do drugs? I just have a look on here
up for seeing clover field tonight? Only thing I won't be able to leave till 7pm as I have a interview for 6.30pm :(
Awesome it doesn't start till 8.40pm so we have time. Anyone else up for it?
Rubage
Nah just say "bugs", that's nice mate :)
How the fuck did you end seeing Puddle of Mudd with Vegan? What a combo!
I knew you knew your variables - I'm back from Lisbon, bloody cold here
Didn't know that loader was leaving, he was the one of the original BD guys wasn't he? 4 year warrior
Has he left already or leaving soon?
A film that you all should see is "Turbo kid" better than mad max
Yeah I'm back from Lisbon. It's better than mad max as it's just really fun & not trying to do anything more than it & more rounded film with a story, soundtrack, character development. Whereas mad max is just cars.
lover Lion - Good expression, dating is like bike riding although I usually get to looking & talking at the bike rather riding it :S
Lover Lion - What you think is a good date app? Used to use a Tinder but I get blanked & no reply
Most women arent into meat like dudes, they are more vegetables. So I would say "fancy a bit of carrot?"
Really? I thought calling someone a donkey = retard or does that mean you're big?
Farms
Yeah I know they not the same but trying to figure out boundaries of their meaning in this context. Like you declaring your variables, you need to know what your variables should consist of
Donkey = animal
Carrot = food
Array = Retards
We should create this as fake blind date show & upset the femaisms
My local park has turned to Peter file land
Clowns look ducking scary & super peter
Do you think like ham or carrots?
*Do you think they like ham or carrots?
Clowns
Next gen fuckage
What happening on Friday or Saturday?
I think you play the final fantasy XV (15), you has a lot of rubies in it
You love it
Yeah that is awesome film, super guilty pleasure
The thing on Saturday looks quite gangster, not sure I'd I handle Gangster anymore especially with my love for ham & vegans
Or is the rave on Saturday quite middle class with no Croydon gangsters?
Duck you Vegan you are such a deacon! Feeling & dealing your carrots!
I don't think I make a good mc
Although no such thing as vegan friendly urban music. Maybe I'm on to something?
Rappers don't rap about vegans or love for vegetables.
Could be Mc onion & sing "chip, chop it's all in the mind"
I'm glad that someone got the reference :) Best rap song ever
I knew that Lion would know that one :)
Cool sounds like fun :) We should do that Shoreditch night again that was fun - Doctors whatever it was called again, Leo's idea
Leo's idea sorry
I'm up for games night tomorrow I bring my pads too. Let's go to yours
I'm up for board game action
Bummer I forgot to bring my controllers :( Epic fail, Do you guys have 4 controllers in total between you all?
how many controllers do you have?
you coming?
Awesome! 4 controllers That's a relief.
I would to speak about evil game tactics to take over the world with two clicks
Sorry I would like to speak Samir about evil game tactocs
Still in office, bloody rape shot project working San Francisco office again
Will go soon
All at stag well?
Shadwell sorry
On my way now, anyone want anything? Bringing boardgame too
Looks pretty good actually, pee myself a little
WTF? He says such bollocks, never a big fan of Peter although at the same time there isn't many famous game designers
Hamgle
Hamoogle
Where is everyone?
Where is everyone?
Not the mud want?
Wank
Where you gone?
We are in breakfast club in London Bridge
Howdy what time you thinking for film club? Going to visit my sister's today & takes forever to your homeland
Get to her homeland & back I mean
I read Leon message earlier & I thought he said "I'm eating a girl at 2pm". Also I justified to myself that was the true message as Lions nees require very high protein intake & alot of sexy bed time
That's my random comment for today
Anyone up for film club tonight?
I wonder why he think Samir is evil, because he doesn't drink wine & cheese
I wonder if he keeps a fish tank of frogs to use for cooking. Eat a frog instead of cheeky kebab
I'm going to stay home sorry I'm too zzzzz & warm to leave now. What about film Wednesday?
Are up animal collective gig tonight? Where r u?
Indeedo
Oh balls :(
That ducks!  Can you not do it afterwards?
I thought you developers code in your sleep
Declare variables from your mind
OK no worries
Shadow DJ I thought he died
Sounds interesting although I have no idea who he is. Sorry :(
Anyone up for seeing "Midnight Special" (no its not a porno) this Sunday at 6.20pm at Hackney House?
I hear it's pretty good
Could go for food afterwards & discuss about the vegan aliens?
"The" implies that film "may" feature Vegan Aliens or "The" meaning our conversation may lead to this topic of discussion
anyway regardless if the film features vegan aliens or not
SIMON CHANG aka Bruce lee
Balls! 6.20pm showing of midnight special has sold out but there is a 4.50pm or 8pm showing, which one people prefer? I vote for the 8pm for me
Still up for it?
If you want to feel kiddy, could see Jungle book at 8.30pm alternatively? Evil Samir 's pre-sequal how he gets his skills to evil mastermind
Fair euough - Are going to see Jungle book on a date? Actually is there any lions in it? It's just tigers & panther from the cat family. What time for midnight special for your vote?
What's the plan for tonight?
You can all come around my place for a film if you like? Although that doesn't help with deciding on the vartiables of where, when & what you watch? Shall we vote? I'm easy for any belong the film finishes before 10.30pm I need my sleep for Monday
OK! Let's do a film night some other time then
I told you they are going take over
The nest is in Dalston, so I can very German & hipster at the same time
you are using my quotes for your Gifs
I feel honored
Brass club?
You're Nicolas Ruby, there is plenty of ways to get extra cash I'm
In
myself & Sam elf were discuss the possibility of pimping you as with the name of Ruby. Could make alot of £££
Not sure about 100% you have give at least 20% for Sam's gentle elf clients/connections as they wouldnt be too long or last long either
Not a good deal?
Exactly
Except the ears
NICOLAS RUBY
You need to my "planet of the vegans" in there or at least plan for the Hollywood sequal
You need to add my sorry
ET is my faves movies
Return of the Jones
Lol hehe
Wow looks amazing visually & conceptually
Is it on kickstarter?
Hopefully they become like   Rockstar rather activsion
Agreed a good publisher
Where you go Samir & Ruby?
Let me in
Does primal have any co-op or mp? Does it have any rubies?
very nice, might get it to play this weekend before uc4. Are you still planning Europe trip? When/where you going?
Can't you just euro train pass it?
Although it would cheaper to drive
Wanna up for this? 
Seems very interesting & bizarre with VR films
Could be wanky but you certainly an experience
It's tomorrow midday
Fair enough, there probably be other things there as it's a festival. If poo, should go & di something. It's not like London hasn't other alternatives
Going to this sci-fi festivial, see how it goes. Let you know nearer the time
Last message 
Looks so awful! Reminds of poor 90's Sci-fi game, my crap has more soul & inspiration
Also has no jewels
For Ruby of course
Let me in im outside
RUBY
Oh ruby Im outside
Did you not dig Berlinerz? & land of Berlin?
The characters were awesome in JSR. I liked the evil cop guy. Music was awesome too, I got the soundtrack. I wish more games had more unique soundtracks/style like that. The days before mega franchises & freeium
Gum the main character was cool!
Too
You should embrace your love hand when you're loney
What you guys doing tonight? Film club or dance club?
Could you handle a film?
The film of choice has the possability to be about Vegans
Lazy Lion
lol
Do you have netflix? Could watch Turbo kid? best film ever!
What time you going to this Old street thing?
Im making a move now actually, probably get to old street about 4ish. Still going to be there?
I know your tactic Lion boy. Brick lane has more toutist young meat for your inter lion. "Ja! Never bumped english man, good scheisse"
I have to say that i'm hurt that you think "we" would damped your likelyhood of bumpage. I think we increase your chances especailly with Ruby around
Fair point. Uncharted 4 has made me emotionful & passionate rather looking with things subjectively
You're in heart of vegan land
Shoreditch is the land of hip vegans
Despire talking about Lion's sex approachs & vegans in land of shoreditch. On more serious note, where is samir?
you coming out?
Planning?
His evil plan to take over the land of vegans?
Where we going for film club? Lion's?
Im at the roundabout. How you get in?
Is a vegan password or anything?
Its worth seeing this place neverless you won't come back the same lion or samir
Its a experience
Ok so whats the plan?
There is many lionlettes here
So you're coming here?
For sure?
Samir & Lion on your way?
Lots of vegans here
You have enter the station & its opposite nim com soup
Robert Stringer
Glad you made it
We are sitting down around the corner as yoi enter near the food places
Getting old we have to sit down
Wanna up for Dark Knight night tonight?
Sorry I rephase anyone up for Dark Knight night tonight?
Shall it do the film night tomorrow instead? As I have shit storm of work to do due to Amsterdam situcation & Ruby has to do washing (I didnt realise he was so clean)
Oh fuck balls
Ruby you can go work dirty. No one cares you're developer
Doctor Variable
Film night still happening or are leaving it for another time?
Poor Ruby
What?
Huh?
I dont understand you are not declaring varables
Or talking with a high degree of reason or logic
Which you do at all times of course
Too much "The shiring" for you sweet cheaks
I used to work Creative Assembley - One of best games companies worked at in terms of game production as well as being employee
Splash Damage I worked at & filled with tossers
CA - everyone was happy & lovely
& knew how to make good games
Rippar
They rip you
Yeah that too
CluelessAR - that doesnt work, need to work on that
I used to play Warhammer when I was a young un but its been at least 15 years
Just saw one of your brothers, you should go & visit
Anyone up for games bash or a movie around my place today/tonight with some beers?
wow that is amazing, you clearly have too much time on your hands
What app you used for that epic video?
your pint
I thought you enjoy "Batman" doesnt the Joker give out rubies or flowers to people he kills if remember correctly?
I remember there is scene where sings alot like musicial. So I can imagine it being pretty dated now :(
Dude you need a lion wank
Just saying it seems you need to get alot out of your system at 2am. I dont think im creppy, just misunderstood. Ive never wanked with ham before, I hear warm watermelon is a good emulation.
Deep!
Matt I hope to see inleash your inner greek tonight
Gone home now to have a wank
You should of went home early & had a wank like me. You would be full of beans by now rather crying in your pants
Does centres count as a "club"?
So what was find with a high likestorm? The Ruby Club?
Yeah they pretty bizarre cult centres
Firebombing? Spreading the words of the power of veganism & as god will strike with fury might to among meat eaters
Wow it sounded like recent con job for a religion
Gone to harrow 2 see a old school friend. You guys up for anything tomorrow?
Howdy, 
Is a list of gigs I've thinking going if you guys are up for it?
KXP - Friday 11th of March - £7 -Not the best band in the world, I quite enjoyed them last time, abit non pretentious fun
Dan Deacon - Thursday 17th of March - £15 - Seen a few quite times but always fun Nicolas Ruby will like this guy too - 
Blanck Mass - Thursday 31st of March - £13 - 
OK great! I will order OPN ticket now too :) Awesome stuff
That's the list :)
Sure, that be awesome I am ham curious
I did indeedo
I will book other tickets tonight
Sure
:)
Pass the word :) Does Leon like this type of music? He strikes me of more hip hop but I probably wrong
Chris Jones added Nick Stone and Leon Tyler to the group.
I've ordered two tickets for Dan Deacon - £16.50 each & Blank Mass for £15 each :). Grimes Sold out annoyingly :( I've invited Ruby & Leon the Lion to the thread - do you guys want to go to come to any gigs mentioned above?
Ruby
Type in Dan Deacon in Spotify & see if you like him - Love it or hate it type deal as he is very colourful. Also you may like Blank Mass as he is very german techno (his latest album anyway)
You're defo more Ruby than Emerald plus your are developer so you should be honoured to named after programming language.
You don't like Nicolas Ruby?
Deep down you love it
Jeremy - Any thoughts on the gigs? What should you're nick name be? Jeremy Ham which sounds like possible evil twin
Aw bless! Glad I'm such inspiration to your lives, you love the rubage
RUBAGE
RUDAGE
Rubage sound sexy
sounds sexy
What did you want to say?
That's amazing name
If you're tory, you're happy to be any type of lord, gay or not
I wonderin the tory world if a gaylord is more or less powerful than normal lord?
Just realised I will be in Lisbon for the Black mass gig you wanna go with Samir in my place?
Got the tickets in person
£13
Don't worry about it
You buy me a ticket on the future

Neon Indian is playing 16th of June if anyone is up for that?
How European of you! Yeah sounds like fun, what dates you thinking?
You might going to Blippar NYC office? No stay in London
Oh yeah just remembered you guys go to see Mass Blank on Thursday in the end?
Its been a while indeed & need some Hay in my life. What you up to next weekend? Hang out & do something
Oh dear - I booked two tickets for explosions in the sky (12th Oct), PoliÃ§a (19th Oct) & Emancipator (20th). In total it works out £65 each roughly. Either buy me that in beer or book up some gigs up for the value in the list. 
Annoying King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard are sold out (must be popular). Only artist I wouldn't or couldn't see is Death Grip they are abit intense and gangster for me and my old age. I prefer my music to be about flowers and animals. 
Let me know your thoughts.
The PunTown
So who is seeing mr scuff (he is probably a vegan)
?
Awesome that it is on Saturday too
Dancing away on skool night can be crappy
You do it anyway sweet cheaks! But dont know how you do it. Do you work better high?
I wish I could do my job high
EVIL SAMIR
Got 2 tickets for Dan Deacon, ordered them while ago
Not sure what time the he starts
You party too hard? 
That's not very Andrew WK of you
Probably aim for 9pm if that good for you?
Village underground is the venue
Where do you go for your fish & chips Fridays?  
Weather spoons at Tower Bridge
?
Simon 's last day tomorrow
Not sure where people are going after work, I let you know once I know
Yup I'm afraid so
I know the app team went out but I think they having food 1st
Shall we somewhere in Shoreditch for some food & drink? Walk to Village Underground
Fancy going 1001 cafe off brick lane, they do a good burger
OK 
Making a move now probably take me 25 mins to get there, see ya there in a bit
Howdy just outside, you want anything to drink/eat?
OK 
Sexy times
No worries you buy me a ticket some time
We are in Thames side Inn 
You coming?
You missed a call from Chris.
Chris called you.
Matt is coming down
Cheers big ears
What time you getting to festivial? I will get there for 4ish
Shall we meet outside or shall I meet you in there?
Im sure there will be plenty of landmarks to spot & meet at
OK IM you when Im my way to festivial if you're inside already, lets figure out landmark. If you're not, lets meet outside
No thanks mate Im getting old
Im walking to Victoria Park now from Hackney Central. Probably be there in 45 mins
Nah sweetcheaks that was 20 min walk but probably felt long because it was new terrain for tou
You
Plus I power walk
You are quite near Victoria Park right? Actually more mile end way?
Im in the park but I can hear it but cant see it. Ive forgot how big this park is
Printed mine. Not sure if you need it
Yeah you need print, bloody ticket master. You need login & print for security I guess
I can always play some Pokemon Go as I wait
Your Costin coming along?

No way really?
Im sitting next to this by box office as you enter
Sitting beside this sign
Before
Where you pick up tickets
Are in the park?
I can see aroundabout

You missed a call from Chris.
Oh dear
I havent had it yet
Yup need nap first I pop out at 11ish/midnight
Where are you? Going to The Nest?
You love Wagner
Can I book ticket at the door?
Im home having a wank, you cant go out with a loaded gun
That is actually from "Something about Mary"
Cant buy tickets on the website mmmmm risky
Are Tara friends there? Are they hot?
You going all UKIP on me again?
If you get there before me, ask if I buy a ticket on the door
You going straight or going somewhere else before hand?
All this messaging no follow thorough?
You missed a call from Chris.
You missed a call from Chris.
Samir oh dear you coming to Star Wars?
5 mins away I meet you in.
I dont know what is or what old nick is. So I meet you at museum
Im here now
Samir oh dear! Any thoughts on when you want to go to NYC? Just thought I could book time off both Barcelona & New York days at RippAR. If book ahead enough, they cant say "No" we have a deadline for another crap app release
Actually maybe it makes sense to just book the flight tickets 1st for cheapest & best dates for us. Just book time from RippAR, if we do it soon, they wont say no
Just do what we with Barcelona, just sit down to book it all one night
Fancy meeting up week to chat about it? Could do it on film night. Meet eariler & ask everyone to come later, otherwise they will be bored
Samir oh dear
Ok awesome sauce!
You be ready to leave at 5.30 today? Also do have Godzilla on your PC, if not we can watch something else
Oh dear
Making your way over yet?
Ok lets cancel & do another day
:(
Actually Leon just left as he couldnt do a late one. Do you still wanna come over?
Are you still being spencer raped?
Man you & West have been seriously scencered! Its skool night so belong its not later 10.30pm, you both are welcome over. Let me know your thoughts
No worries. I said Leon that I would arrange board games session on Sunday if you're up for that
Or go to see la la land
Yup
Why am I the prize?
Why? Because they are so bad
Do I want to this?
You arent going to sent me Donkey pictures again are you?
Flat 10,
Aster Court, 
Woodmill Road,
E5 9GB
Your ways?
Sounds sexy
Nah Im abit tired 2bh, you going?
Having a wank
Sorry mate I'm not feeling up to it
I may send messages of inspirations
Sure. Its all seems very political with Ryan, its like having a drink with Rish. May be fired
OK what time you want to meet?
7.30/8?
I'm working from home today I won't be leaving you either way
I was planning to go to gym at 5 then food/drink 7ish
7 sound good?
Awesome sexy sauce
Yeah let's meet there then
Have you left the office yet?
Getting ready to walk down to Olso
You sure?
Ok I will leave now
See ya there
Give me 10 secs
Chris called you.
SAMIR OH DEAR
Ive become the pants
Samir oh dear
Probably some Zelda in my pants before popping out. What's the plan? Need a wingman tonight?
Indeed I
Indeed I
I haven't started playing it yet
Starting now
London fields is good but it's very trendy & vegan
Yeah I'm game for that, what time roughly we talking 10/11ish?
Yeah same
10ish sound good?
There isn't many of us in UK, they are all in SF
Yeah message around & see who else is up for it
JC frenchy
WoW
True but he is a sex pest
Nah I bet he was super strikes out
Sure beans
He is like teenage
He needs to unload his gun before he goes out
Just eating dinner
Where is the place? Shall I meet you there?
Have you asked them what place is called? Also if we can buy tickets at the door?
It only takes 20 mins to get there & I be passing that London area to get yours. What time shall I meet you? It's open till 1.30am & there is a pub called "The dolpfin" which is meant to be open quite late & it's fun
They still deciding?
You going now?
Fair enough cool see y'a in 40
Not sure if I deal with frog talk solo, they are alright I just never know what to say plus I don't think they understand a word I'm saying to them
On the bus now be there in 20
Crotian girls aren't here they coming?
JC is here with some of his mates
No it's NT around a side of a building
You see lots of people outside
You have to go upstairs, what do you want to drink?
I've been waiting for 10 mins to be served
Gun & tonic
Fin
Fin
I'm on rooftop section
I can't reach JC too many people with 3 drinks in my hand
Samir oh dear where you go?
Hope you're getting your bone on. Before you do that, I need to get my coat :s
I don't want to be a cock block
WoW just got up
What a night!
No worries, glad my wingman duties worked  You home or you still at their place?
You wanted to read her some poetry to be true romantic
?
Oh I see
Listening to Nick Cave, you hear his latest album?
The real Q: are you going to see her again?
Rec it?
Yeah it's hard listen but you get into its great. Usual sound reminds of tom waits
Old Skool but really creative & emotional
That's code for sexy times isn't?
Oh dear
You & Ruby are heart breakers
LOL
It's tricky one but you can't help how people feel
Emotions are messy
But maybe you need to say something before she gets hurt
No one wants to be heart breaker
Then again at least you won't feel bad if you still bumping
You're done your bit & she can't say that you broke her heart but you clearly stated what you want
Then again I'm rubbish at this stuff. So maybe I'm not the best person for advice on sexy times
How's the coffee?
Surely she has a flight soon or she going tomorrow morning
So was she a onion or a lettuce?
Up for film night tomorrow, not sure what to watch/where?
To meet Another onion?
You're now in today? You missed a bomb scare everyone is outside
Not in sorry
Yeah indeedo
Howdy Samir, you up to anything tonight? Fancy coming for Clapton way for filmage or drinkage?
Ok let me know what you doing afterwards, either I come meet you where you are or you come to my area. If Max wants to come, that is cool too
OK what's the pub called? I probably won't get there till 10ish
Cooking dinner, 30 mins to cook, 30 mins to eat. 10 mins to get ready. 45 mins to get Wapping that is 2 hours
I message you when I'm about to leave & let you know you're at & meet you there
I thought I give exact timeage, you Devs love precise numbers
About to make a move, where you at?
What's the pub called?
Indeedo
The shins in those one of 1 album every 5 years type bands
Yeah they are great
Yeah Indeedo
On more boring matter, need to sort out monies. You pay for Barcelona Airbnb, I've bought the flight & Airbnb for NYC
Huh?

Is there you're not bothered about in things to see list?
That is 4 days, you can see alot in 4 days
Fair enough! Just didn't want to go MOMA for an example whilst you're in SF & you wanted to really go. I guess Drugs & bone are more your thing for NYC
Well this time I hope doesn't do some random drug deal on the streets. Hopefully Pat or something will have a honest true businessman  connection for that
Or someone I mean
Like a AJ
He is compared to guys we dealt with Barcelona
Thank you for your money & I'm going to steal a phone off you
Drug we sell aren't really drugs
So Art doesn't inspire or improve your variable declaration or boning techniques? Or Food or drink habits?
I was thinking to do high line & central park when you're back
Maybe MoMA as that is central park I think
The real Q: So Art doesn't inspire or improve your variable declaration or boning techniques? Or Food or drink habits?

Early bird catches the worm

Chris called you.
O'Reilly's again. Shall we meet somewhere else? Yeah we went to home sweet home which was like 50's disco & went to redneck bar on breaker street near cafe what?
We certainly have adventure s
I think it was called "off the wagon"
It was near cafe wha?
Chris called you.
I'm a bit too zzzz to do it today we will sort it out soon. Can you afford for the flight & Airbnb in 1 payment? Or should setup monthly payments?
International holidays are pricey
Where you guys go?
Sorry I just woke up. You fancy meeting in Dalston 2ish? So we look for a Jesus picture for Harris & figure out materials/how to build the Mexican wall?
Samir oh dear
OK cool
See ya in a bit
Good Q: mmmm what about Dalston Kingsland station?
5 blocks away
Oh Samir you're going to be at least 20 mins away. Actually let's meet at that pub across the station where we went with Lion.
School of dancing
Yes I guess so, im there now. What do you want to drink?
Bus was faster than usual
Samir oh Dear, Ruby wants to go up north this Satrusday
you might get in there and inform him otherwise
What is the name of the conference you're taking him this satursday?
Oh dear
Shit! you have a link?
To give him
What if Ruby goes up north?
I guess we have to delay for the weekend after
what bollocks! Special conference
serect conference
I'm not going to but trying to convence them
No
Just keen it open I said "Conference or something"
You could of said anything something else
Maybe a few beers if you don't mind
I forgot to ask if they were free and invite them without knowing what event is
How is the question?
How? is the question I mean
I guess so but then we have delay for next week then
Even if Sam & Ruby don't turn up
Oh Samir you're eyes remind of donkeys
your eyes sorry
You have hair of a horse
You have skin of a turtle
You hear of broken social scene? They are playing in London; if you up for it? Wed 24th of May - £30
I hear rumours that you had long chat with Mel today? Are you alright?
That's relief :)
Oh bollocks sorry
When & How?
Nah
So what is the situcation?
So you will look for another job soon? Or they havent confirmed for sure?
Just a "Howdy". I think Ruby may get some bone tho
When will be your last day?
Oh fuck dude
So sorry that super sucks
So your options find another role or garden leave?
Ruby & I get another role on lens/face if you want
Oh Samir oh dear, you could just do it to buy time for NYC job you want
Well you have the skillz to pay the billz so fair enough
If cash is a problem you can always claim benifits
I guess what Im trying to say  is that you will be fine
Have no doubt about that & benifits would be come to push/ worst case scenario
So finically will be fine either way so money isnt the concern
Samir oh dear did you get around to creating welcome back sign for the party? If noy I will create one tonight
OK I will try to make one tonight
Do you wanna come over again for some more DIY? This isn't a love affair or date
Going to make the legs tonight and test the wall before building it at your flat as we won't have much time to build it. I will need exact rules (Ikea style)
Wanna come over?
I've sold Nick & Sam on Rubyicon
You planning to keep Sam & Nick & returning to yours for 8pm right?
I will ask people to turn up 7ish before Nick and Sam turns up
Samir on dear
I can say people to turn up for 7pm
?
And you will be back with sam & Ruby by 8ish?
Ok awesome!
Im heading to The Miller for one drink want to meet there or you wanna meet me at my place?
Whats your plan Samir oh dear?
I thought I leave you to it as you looked like you were getting your bone on
Samir oh dear I need your keys to get into your flat
Do you have any heavy books I could use for weights to keep the wall up straight?
What drink/food you have?
I buy torilla chips at your local shop right?
Stephanie is such a pain
If you dont want to do it, dont waste my time with BS promises
What time you taking Nick out?
On my way to Dalston to get some tape & string & cheap party crap
Could you get some drinks &  snacks for the party? Hide them in your room
Before you take the Ruby out
Created the legs/support for the wall.
Just hope it will survive the night as keep standing up
What is the code to get your building?
Or do I need a fod?
Chris called you.
Chris called you.
On the Ubar now
Heading towards your place now
I had the some werid looks from the driver
Ok sure, what time is he coming back?
So he knows about the party
?
Is the plumber coming?
A real one or is this somerhing from your code?
No to both? What type of plumber is this?
Or are you the plumber?
Chris called you.
Come on mate
Samir oh dear, just wanted to say "Hi"
How are things?
I'm wfh
I just had a skype interview
I did
I was going to shave it off but I thought if they going to judge me on my haircut if they like or dislike, clearly have too much money or time on their hands
It was hard to read as they seem to give very little away
But I thought it went well
It was alot better than the last one I did
You get better, the more you do
Have you started looking yet? Or you focused on your freelance work?
Yeah better much :) Fair enough, you probably need some time to reflect on the situation & figure out the best option going ahead
Masters doing what?
I see :)
I've been thinking about front end development/JS courses (8 - 12 weeks) in Berlin & Barcelona (because they are lot cheaper than London)
Berlin or Barcelona sorry
True
Weighting up the options, alot of reflection
May go for Berlin in Sept as I'm more likely to actually do some work as Barcelona would get excited by the sun and ladies all the time
Berlin is quite similar to London in weather
Maybe we should go before ypu go to States
Good place to go in the summer
As its not too hot
Berlin is cheap for cheap city in europe. Yeah I know what you mean. With a Masters, do you get more job opportunities?
cheap for captial city I mean
What university you thinking about going in the states?
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Its funny. I would thought of institutes would consider work experience as qualification
I see what you mean. Especially for bigger companies, they like you know that you certain level of knowledge
true
Start ups don't give a crap but depends if you want to work Start ups. I'm personally abit put off with the XP from Blippar
Bigger companies you get more benifits/job security, etc
I try not to take it too seriously
You coming into the office tomorrow?
Awesome, you want to go somewhere special for your last day at RippAR?
where are you Samir oh dear?
I grabbed your wrap
No I don't grab & eat
grabbed as prevented other takers
i can't right now & also that is crap pub
Or are you wanting to go for a trip down memory lane to say goodbye never having to go there?
Where is Ruby?
Is he not around to declare some important variables?
Damo is raping you too? I guess its good money, make sure he doesnt take you for too much of a ride
You missed a call from Chris.
You missed a call from Chris.
Howdy, dont mean to nag. Just wondering if you had any funds to pay remaining monies for NYC? £500 for trip & Airbnb. You wanna set up monthly payment, do it installments?
Yeah indeedo
Cheers big ears
Lovely, thank you
Not yet  making my way now
What time you getting there?
Be careful with what you try bring in but they dont rub & search you tho. But checks bags
Watching forest swords, they are pretty good. Messaged M but no reply yet
You nearby?
Near the Bumble tent /Waltzers which is left side of  "Eat your Ears" main stage
Nah opposite end
I can meet "The barn" if that is easier
I will be heading soon to see Nicolas Jaar
At 6.30
Ok meet around the right hand side of the barn outside by ice cream van
Are in now? Just walking the entrance
By the entrance I mean
That narrows it down
Yeah created another thread with Lion in it
Yeah sounds like a plan. Come over
Shame about Lion boy
She seems like hard work
I mean shame about his relationship/bone
Hope he figures it out
Bone is complicated
So you still coming over yeah?
I can come over but it wont get to yours till 8ish
Will the god join us?
Or is just playing god?
Ruby eats?
I thought he just codes?
Whats your passcode again?
Troll 2? Or The Room?
Shit art film
Never seen that one
Whats your post code? Im leaving now
Anthony = £400 per day 
Steph = £350 per day
Usually tho you get paid that for really boring work that no one wants to do like testing or developing databases. I did freelance for a while, most of the work is really boring. Blippar is really exciting on compasion
Why Harris is asking as he has left right?
Yeah why not? Its good money
I would ask for 400, they can always pitch you down
Ask them if they need any QA :P
They will get Oliver to do that
Thailand?
Thanks
Ok I should do that, thanks
Did you get Rippar freelance gig?
Fair enough, maybe he looking for some more cash.
Although I thought he had a new job in London
I hear he is back too, he should arrange drinks with him
Yeah true at least he is crazie like us
Fair enough, sounds good

Yes your 3rd arm, your Johnson, your dick, your Jimmy. You get the idea I'm sure
Maybe you're right, I'm thinking about it. Your bone just gets you in trouble especially when I was younger. I couldn't control it.
You guess the rest no doubt
So drinks tomorrow then? Mudlark I guess?
Estimations or expectations?
Estimate is a value of time? So I change your time?
Estimate as guessing what I will say?
You pissed? Samir oh dear
This is normal conversation, you wait till I get conceptional.
This is normal for us.
It's been getting good reviews
It's next door to that neon light place we went to 
Free fire is this Thursday, right? Want to do film club on Wednesday or should this be replacement?
I like the new name
Oh Lion boy, hope you get better soon. Or is this your way of saying I rather tame/ride my GF.
?
I'm very disappointed that it doesn't say Lion  Tyler for your name
or Lion Tamer
We haven't seen him in ages so I thought it been good to hang out
Film club tonight? 7pm at my place or is that too late?
7 is good or later?
you coming?
GRRRRAAAAWWWW
Oh shit dude
Just tell her you love her
I hope things work out
Are you alright?
We watched 2 films in the theme of "Awful & bizarrely odd but good"
Fateful Findings 
Samurai Cop 
Even Ruby was watching abit whilsting Rubying (coding).
I though Logan was pretty good. I liked how emo & hopeless it was. Interesting to see such powerful character fragile
Samurai cop has better action than any of them - Action in a different scene
lots of T & A action
and sword action
Further lion fan love or trolling whatever you want to call it
Im up for it. Having quite stressful & troublesome day so I'm up for whenever. Just say when & where  & I'm there.
What time shall we come over?
Are you in the office Samir?
Who's West?
I shall leave with you when you're ready
Nah I can't do that, see you at Lion's at 7 then hopefully I can leave earlier
Alright to turn up for 7?
At dalston station walking up now
Im outside. What number are you?
Donkey beer
Do you want food?
Ruby god!
You need to come up with a some ways to get some cash in
Freelance
?
I used to use Elance
Regarding NYC, shall we start looking at Airbnb places?
If that is option, we need to think about sound cage or sound booth as you are loud vadar sleeper.
Ok I will have a look now incase that isn't a option
What about this? 
£50 each per night
£600 for 12 nights
Place in Williamsburg in Hipster land which is more central - 
£619 per each
NYC isn't cheap
We can but will be further out
I think we need to look at them together like we did with Barc to get this booked up quickly
You guys have to speak with Pat & Mike to see if we can stay at their for a few days? At least we save some money
He has one bed right?
I think that is a plan
Let's figure this on Sunday
figure this out on Sunday
In the mean while, ask  Pat and Harris
You guys free on Sunday?
Samir oh dear
Fancy spending some time tonight or tomorrow for the NYC Stuff? It seems unlikey that John wick will happen tonight
Tonight or tomorrow?
Ruby god free tonight?
Wanna go to a bar/pub? Or shall I come over to yours? Or you guys come to my place?
You did or Ruby did?
Was it sexy time or drug times or both?
You do Dinner?
Sounds amazing
What time shall I come over? What's address again?
Shall I bring anything?
Any dessert?
I mean shall I bring dessert or Ruby beer?
Shall I come over for 8pm?
8ish
Just wrapping this test for another job
Asos
Is John wick 2 downloadbale?
Have you asked Mike & Pat if Ruby & I can stay at their on Friday & Sat (when you're in SF)? We can stay at the Brooklyn Rivera for one night £20 or could stay there till Samir returns?
DFS
Sorry I'm in my way to the gym to try to become Chris Pit. I can come out later tonight if you guys are still around
7ish
Where you going for dinner?
I may have dinner at home save £££ but you're in Shoreditch area right?
At your house?
Is there any good restaurants in Bethnal Green?
BG is very easy for me to its two stops on the train
But it's a coffee shop & closes at 7
Ruby
Awesome :)
Times
Samir & Steph coming? Meet for 7.30pm?
Ok so 7.30 sounds good for you to meet at Ruby House?
Ok I hope there are actually rubies at this place
Still on for 7.30? About to leave?
Any word from Pat or Mike for staying?
Sexy times :) When shall other tings? After work tomorrow
?
Book the other places
You guys fancy going for a beer & book up NYC stuff tonight?
Ok let's do tomorrow instead then I'm still at work
RippAR
Is that still happening?
You happy for him to book that hostel we saw on Sat to stay there for Thursday then?
Thurs = Hostel
Frid - Sun = Harris 
Mon - onwards - Airbnb
they are alright myself & ruby god staying at theirs for this period? Between Friday to Sunday?
Yeah sure as they are agreed to this or Yeah sure we just going to turn up to take over with Ruby force
So they don't know that we are coming?
Do they know that I like Donkeys and Ruby is a snorer?
Really? They know that will invite all NYC donkeys to their flat & have donkey party
The donkeys will eat the onions, they like fresh tight veg
Lost?
Donkeys like fresh veg in both contexts
As food or sexy times
Donkeys are horny animals
Samir He said "You bring the donkeys and I'll bring the onions."
Onions could mean food or pussy. I saying that Donkeys would be willing to eat both of these objects
Doesn't have to be oral sex, could be any type of sex
True
How do you know? Have you asked a donkey?
Oh Ruby. Anyway back to the orignal topic, shall I book that hostel for Thursday?
Myself & Ruby was saying that we don't want to stay there too long as we don't want to take the piss
2/3 days will be alright but after that, its just get silly plus I like to sleep on a bed
You flying out from Friday to SF? So you want a bed as well for Thursday for the hostel?
Link 3 is safer bet but looks typical whereas Link 7 is more risky but more raw and you would want to spend there on the roof, etc
I mean spend time there
mmmm choices what are your thoughts?
You left the sheet without saying bye!
OK you reckon Link 7?
Let's sleep on it just wanted to your thoughts
I have to do a later onw
one
You want to do the Airbnb shopping at 6 for 30 mins then I can pop back to work
On the train now sweetcheaks
I'm going say that we are art students who want to study ruby donkey art
Oh ruby god you don't trust me
I promoted you to a God from a developer
Have you considered that the fact I could be right & you are actually a god?
Actually quite difficult
What should I say to Edars for the flat on Airbnb?
Hi Edars, 
Me and my two friends are coming to New York for the 1st time and your apartment looks like great stay for our holiday.
Should I say anything else?
We are vegans
Edgar
sorry
Shall I say anything else?
Hi Edgar,
How it going?
Myself and my two friends are coming to New York for the 1st time and your apartment looks like great stay for our holiday.
Shall I say anything else?
Hang on for what?
Hi Edgar,
How it going?
Myself and my two friends are coming to New York for the 1st time and your apartment looks like great stay for our holiday. Great location and a cool space to check out the city and chill out in the evening. 
We would love to stay.  Let me know your thoughts. 
Thanks, 
Chris
Its booked yipppee
You guys own £258 each
not yet
I've never booked a airbnb before
its cheap for NYC and its good flat
and you have your own room to snooze your heart out
Awesome sauce. I got confirmation for Airbnb. Frog girl wants to come if Sam & Stephanie they can book their own place
How you finding MV?
That's what I hear. Its Super subs, just housing & school s
You should go to the Google campus
Or go to SF for the weekend
You have the flat to yourself for 2 months
Should have a donkey -Ruby party
Someone has to love
I think I can understand why that may be confusing. Have you explained your name calling thing? Also the fact you're a Ruby God?
I thought you're in MV office or you on in SF office? I thought works in SF office
MV office must be packed. Isnt filled with lots of geeks?
Content verification?
Make to sure the content data is correct
How many people in MV office then? Have you met Raj?
He is dick head so rude
Telling you Variables are correct?
Lol
He is quite nice
How do you know Thayga loves QA?
Did he tell you that he is a QA god?
You don't like him?
Does he like Ruby?
Nah I have man flu again
& rather play Zelda in my pants
Regarding statue of Liberty visit, you go to the crown to the top but those tickets are sold out. You need to book months in advance. But you visit the grounds of statue & Ellis Island including ferry rides its $25.50 each. Shall I book tickets for Tuesday, the day you're back from SF? If not, go by myself no worries.
Also bear in that mind they recommend that this is a day trip so you get there 2pm or after, you won't be able to see Ellis Island. Will need to get there early
its only $10 per day
Probably need to figure out where we meet each other on the 1st day. If you are still coming
Newark is the airport me & Samir are coming from. Maybe meet in the centre like Times Square area
Yes which Question?
Yes to storage or yes to state of liberty tickets or yes to both?
Samir where are you today?
Fucking sweet checks, what party lasts for 24 hours?
Samir oh dear
Were they feeding lots of pizzas & pasta as well?
yup
13th to 24th
Oh really? I thought you're Rubyneck
You're becoming Dubynexk
Rubyneck
I thought you loving American way of life
Shoot ya way out of problems
Go lizzrd spotting
What uncertainty? Like how long you will be in mV office or NY trip?
I know how you feel
App QA can't stay in London for the long term
I would for San Fran but not MV. Although you drive each day from San Fran to MV right?
If you lived there, you could drive right? So it is a option
Every major city is expensive London no different
Quite silly as 2000 dollars on a donkey?
For a cupboard?
Same as NYC
Called the flat "The Ruby palace*
As apart of the negotiations
Blipp rape palace
Samir oh dear you feeling better?
Shall I ask Christan to kiss you better?
Ok rephrase a blipp condition but to leave as a follower. Rish will love that & think it's because of him
Samir his GF
Temp love or whatever you want to call her
Samir's onion
Who is the girl below in the pix?
Ryan's rape face
Work out as what type of person she is?
Onion?
You doing your Ruby neck tricks already?
Going to ask her to check out your shotgun
In this context you're real shotgun
Your real shotgun
Did you tell that you're Ruby god?
She fall for you in SF land they love techies
I see
Lessons from the master noted
She family member?
I think half of the world will know my name because of you
Oh fuck :( Poor girl
That's sucks. It's common for nice girls to be taken by power hungry bumwipe
Abit of wild card saying that could of been very awkward if you did say that. Although might made a day
Makes me sad to see happen to the nice ones
She was Tara & now she is James sodea
Back to London from New York?
Still SF to New York?
We need figure out where to meet in NYC
oh dear - you alive?
Just wanted to see if you alright?
if are you alright?
Feeling better?
so you wanna see the lady liberty in NYC? Shall I book a ticket?
Samir oh dear
$25 to be exact so probably works out about £18. Ferry to the island to statue of liberty, then ferry to Elis Island which is another island, you get entrance for museum on Ellis Island. Then ferry back to NYC
I going to go anyway, so let me know because you need to book
Yeah we could do that but isn't abit weird just turning up & we won't be doing any work
I don't know how big the office is
Yeah the office is quite central, near penn street station which is one of the main stations like london bridge I guess
You guys fancy going to baseball game in NYC? Never been to one before
Where shall we meet you in NYC? Could boringly meet at Blippar office as myself & Samir are going to drop off our bags there anyway
Baseball is boring, I thought Americans go ape shit for it & start crying when their team is losing
Sorry baseball is boring?
Could go basketball match but that is very expensive right? As arenas are small like tennis
Baseball is like Soccer in terms of size of the arena is. Because I'm not a sports person at all but its good to going to see sports in different countries but get cheap tickets. Like I went to see football match in Lisbon it's so different than the UK, the rival fans were hugging each other wishing their team good luck & really pleasant. Whereas in UK they been fighting & stabbing each other.
Ok fair enough. Any other sports you recommend? I've been to a ice hockey match before that was quite fun, I doubt NYC will have ice hockey
Basketball a option?
Funny I'm sure I met Lisa before
Oh Dear
Became Blippar Celebrity
Before I became
I think we should do something with NYC Blippar crew at one night although I don't wanna do much as I wanna get away from work
At least one night
FYI I bought 12 onions
6 white 6 red
Haggis was telling me that there is local hipster market where he could sell them if you want to make some cash
I was going to give them to nice American I met as present
Any woman I want to sleep with just give a onion. They won't know what that means
I could buy but thought any more won't get past customs
Buy more sorry
Although regarding woman comment. I wonder what response I get?
I've packed them in my suitcase in a bag
How many onions are bringing Samir on dear?
Are you bringing sorry
No but still could be considered to used for commercial purposes. 12 onion is alot of onion for one person
Will say that all of the onions are for gifts
Lol
I think 12 isn't too much or small enough for decline
So you think 12 is too much?
Oh fuck
True, seems such a shame. Fucking Trump Fuck
& a cheeky wink
Hehheeee
Certainly I have plenty of onion to last me a year or so
Do onions go off?
Lol
Really? That is crazy?
I thought he was on holiday
Shame I liked him
See ya Ruby god
Fancy coming to central park later? It's a nice day. Or could you both tonight? Probably need a disco nap before a hardcore one if that is the plan
NICOLCAS RUBYAGE

?
Where are you guys? We are on ferry back to NYC & will be going to Katz sandwich place will be there in 30 mins. Do you wanna join us?
Declaration of actual facts: No they are not communicating
Samir communicates "meeting at 5.30pm at Katz, get a move on"
Have you receive transition & enough data to make decision?
All these sentences are spoken in Robot voice if that wasn't clear
Nah not hear anything
Yet
Back at the appartment, sorry I had to go I'm tired. I get grumpy when I'm tired, hope you get your dicks wet. If not, i will help you both tomorrow.
Nah we popped out to prospect park. You can meet us or meet back at appartment as will be back soonish as the original intention to buy some supplies
Making own way back now Ruby god
My 4G connection is working now, how weird. Anyway still in the museum. Will message you when I get back to hotel & have a disco. Probably meet you later 9ish/10ish
Samir where are you guys? Had my disco nap now. Where shall I meet you? Still sorting out my data so may need to Google map before I leave
Have you both dinner yet?

Yup
Ok Ruby god
2 stops away, waiting for the train to move.
I can meet at No Name bar if you like
Howdy, just getting up. Weather is sunny today so you're both up for Corey Island? Probably take 1 hour to get ready & have breakfast & 1 hour to get there. So you wanna there 1.30/2ish?

Spot the ruby
What's the plan today? Still up for the Blippar lunch?
If not, I can do last bits of shopping
Do you want to leave at 3.30pm from outside the Blippar office? Get a Ubar to Newark Airport & gives us 3 hours
Actually I'm going to get breakfast now & then go to trump tower. I really want those caps. I see how it goes for time but may meet earlier, if not will meet at Blippar office at 3.30pm
Ruby
On West 41st street
Will jump in Ubar in a bit to get to Blippar office
You trolling me again?
What's the address?
Very funny
Making a move from the hotel, will be outside of the Blippar office in 20 mins
Where are you guys?
I'm outside the office now
I just wait for you here
The same one as last week
236 W 30th St
You both in the office?
You in the office or not?
Good timing, same here. Probably take a hour to get through security checks & pick up our luggage
Not sure, still on the plane. United airlines is a great airline
We are surrounded by crying babies, I was attempted to start punching them in their faces to shut them up few hours ago
We are on Terminal 2. Looking at Ubar & to be picked up you need to be at short term carpark. Not sure there is one on T5 or you want to come to meet us at T2?
Hacksaw any good?
Arrival is very good isn't?
Clearly you enjoyed arrival if you fell asleep
Yeah I actually don't feel too sleepy considering
T2 carpark
We can come to you but is there a carpark there?
We are coming
Send a pix
We are on our way so if you coming to us, you better say
To get to you we need to train to T5
Because we don't know exact location getting Ubar to find you is like asking pin in a haystack
Yes
8 mind wait for the train
8 mins
Yeah it's 2 degrees
Share me your Airbnb review doc so I post it on my Account today. The fucker deserves a crappy review
We are at T5 & getting a elevator to arrivals
We can see a boots, whsmith
No Costa yet
See M&S
We are outside car rental
Dude I have serious jetlag, fell asleep at 2ish & just got up, slepted through my alarm
Epic fail
I've become American, I have a urge for a burger or pizza or some tacos
Right now
Samir oh dear
Ruby god
Even your Israel Love & her onion?
Oh OK, it going to take a while to get in the swing of things. I probably will be doing more face testing. Fucking face
I don't give a face fuck
Is there any good pubs in Whitechapel way? Fancy a pint there?
Yes ruby god, talking about later
I enjoyed your shooting dog google search
You're not in the one near Liverpool street are you? On Holywell row?
I'm talking about Old King's Head pub
nah I've found it
where are you guys? It's like where's Wally?
Sorry to be a bore but I need to sort the monies. 80 bucks for your extra case & 70 for the Uber to the NYC airport = £115. Then it was £40 each from airport to home (London), not sure why it was so much but we didn't sugar talk him. So total is: £155 for these bits. We talk about flight & Airbnb later.
god. The total you own me is £250 for Airbnb & £40 for Uber in London. So total is: £290.
My bank details are: AN: 42557398
Sort code: 40-06-21
Thanks
RUBY GOD
Oh yeah you finish the review for Airbnb?
Just paid off £600 bill on credit card
Holiday blues is really kicking in :(
Do you think this could be a good vinyl present for Patrick West?
Could draw some curlys on & a beard & say ironically that it looks like him
In hindsight it's suit enough
Shit
Not shit enough
OK sounds good, I buy it tomorrow. Next item need to search for Jesus picture for Harris
Go to Dalston tomorrow, fancy meeting there?
It's a bank holiday
god - You have Airbnb review ready yet? if not I will post review tonight.
Also monies!
I was talking to Ruby god. I forgot add 
The rest for you I need to have a look
Is he boning again?
I've just jealous
£600 for Airbnb & flight. Shall we say £500? As you probably bought me at least £100 of drinks over the week there anyway
Ruby Person - £290
Oh Ruby
£290
Is the exact & correct number
What?
What is the context?
I don't even know what a coil is other than from tower defense games, where it is slow but powerful firing tower for killing boss enemies with lots of health
Yes
For me yes
Ruby god
You're developer god, why do need this data to proceed?
Surely you dont care about the actual data, but care how what data type needed for the system. For an example, making weapon system with varibles like range, damage per hit, radius, spread, reload times, amount of bullets per clip. You dont care if its rocket machinegun which shots out 5 rockets per second with instant kill
The actual value or quantity is irrevant datapoint for what the system needs to operate. It doesnt matter if its 50,000 bananas or  bananas. Belong "Value" & "Quantity" are entered to system to make a result
Sorry I mean 50,000 or 5 bananas
That is game design not a system design
irrelevant data
A god has spoken
I don't believe in gods
that is because you believe you're god. I doesn't matter what I believe
If it helps get you where you need to go, I'm happy to call you anything
Captain Nickolas
I enjoy our chats of nonsense, trying to give you something think about it but it never works
Ruby god isn't your name, it's your nick name
1.) Context or not, I don't anything about coils so my opinion isn't valid for your dataset.
2.) You need flexible high level practices (generic) for functions for the world you are creating for various of contexts/use cases. Function is a object to move, value for move could may be 5 which is walking or could be 50 which is running. As creator of this function need to allow users (developer/designer or whoever) pick rather whatever value they want to use in the context for their content (for this example, let's say a game). So belong you set min or high values (a cap) actual value doesn't matter for creator, but matters for the designer.
Food for thought anyway
So are you Ruby God or a Ruby developer?
It's inspirational talk rather than direct how to do this
There is no wrong or right, just ideas or concepts
You certainly earn it & value it once you get it
You have Airbnb review ready
Yet?
Its RubyCon.
Most mind blowing event in East Londin
London
Airbnb review - only have 1 day left to post a review
Shit! What pub you in?
Oh ruby god
RubyCon has many guests as you're not the only Ruby developer you know
What statement can you make? If you didnt see anything?
I was sitting in the pub with my friend Sam Strong who is a giant
VAT 69 good?
Howdy gods, I've been researching Web development courses to learn JS and web development in London, Barcelona & Berlin. its costs like £5k to £8k for 2 - 3 months intense courses. Just shared you a comparison doc for these courses and I wanted to get your thoughts if what they cover is good/useful for future employment as a junior Dev.
Basically if you think the courses could be good or just BS for they cover
Yeah take your time, just doing lots of research. Won't make a decision for another weeks at least
Thanks gods!
Us?
Yes you are gods of development. what is name of your engine/framework? Samir on girls?
At least dev community wont never forget your name if takes off
Believe it or not, there is alot of money in that stuff. You dont make money directly from the product but licensing & membership to community, etc like Node JS
Yeah its werid business model
Server side JS code
I guess you could license out the girls but I guess that would make you into a pimp. Can't imagine you being into pimping
Ruby I would. you would pimp out all of Blippar girls if you could wouldn't you? Especially Tara
Yeah its werid how Tech companies make money isn't it? Like Blippar, I don't really understand how they made the money so far other than Bespoke blipps & investments
Yeah indeedo. You still at Pub? Ruby with you?
Wowzer
Samir oh dear
Lameo  
£290 you own me, pay up! 
AN: 42557398

Can you not use internet banking? Just do it that way. If you havent, you need words with you bank to get you to 2017
Oh Ruby god
Oh Ruby you have the money to pay up?
On other note, you guys had a chance to look at Compansion JS course sheet I shared you?
Scroll up sweetcheeks
I like your reference
Thanks for monies
Typical god like attribute, focusing on bigger problems I'm sure
I have to say one of the most nicest & weridest work interview experiences I had today. I had a interview with CTO at 3.30pm, then popped to have a coffee with previous QA manager (now product manager), then went to the pub to meet some developers. Then I was on the tube with QA manager (Just got back). Epic
Lol maybe its abit bizzarely nice.
Keep this between us but I just asked Hollie out for a drink
It didn't go accordingly to plan as she said "No". It's interesting because if she wanted to shag surely she say "yes". Or have got all this wrong?
Thanks :)  Yeah I trying to figure out what that means, maybe just likes the attention/the gossip rather the act
Yeah true, let's see how this Friday plays out
With Mateja, did/do you even go for drinks with just her?
Wondering if I send the wrong message? MMM I don't know
So how did it first happen? You were both out on work drinks on a friday? If that makes sense?
I see. I guess it is a number game, if you go out enough, the more likey such situcation may happen.
You guys wanting to come Lion's tonight?
Oh dudes. What am going to do with you both?
Yeah I know the feeling, looking for jobs & interviews feels like a 2nd job. Although im not putting much effect into RippAR job right now
Doing the minnial, its not like anyone cares for what has tested or not
Actually been tempted to give in my notice anyway as I'm only there for the money now
Would go to San Fran for holiday? Or it boring for sight seeing? Just filled with Tech geeks
and Hipsters
1st world problems planning my next holiday
not sure where
Be good to do something cool between jobs
July
Salt Lake City is shit isn't it?
I wouldn't mind going Toronto
although may be abit boring
What about Austin?
I hear that is a cool city
Probably need to drive to go other cities in Texas
Oh really? So its a no no
I don't think we want to give you a bad name
Ruby will start wiping his ass on their pillows
I'm talking July
thinking Monday 3rd till Monday 17th - 2 weeks
Would you both be up to go to San Fran again so soon?
Or do a cheap one like Italy or Spain?
Fair enough
If we were to go away, need to cheap & cheerful one
Maybe go here: 
Wasn't this place where some girl was giving blowjobs for drinks
it was on the news for some reason
Yeah I wouldn't mind although Iceland is very expense
Hwongy countries?
Yeah indeedo but Samir won't be able afford that for July
that is if you're become the ruby god and finish Ruby on Whales

Dialogue exchange I had with Lisa. 
Lisa: Where is Nick? 
Chris: He is coming later for the office beers
Lisa: Oh yes you have office beers at 5 on fridays right? 
Chris: Yeah. Also we are going out to Shoreditch later if you're up for it? 
Lisa: Is Nick going out too?
He wants your ruby
She wants sorry
That exchange seems to suggest that he wants to see you to go out
I'm not as direct as you but I can directly ask if you like
"Will you come out with Nick later tonight as he wants to bone? It would save my cousin!
But she will come if you show your face
OK

Soho is very well to do so I'm not sure I be let in but I'm up for the adventure
You going to bring your dad along?
Shame :( What is his 1st name? I Just call him whatever his 1st name + "Oh Dear"
Huh? Victims from me!

Why?
Surely there is a reason or is this random person you started sending messages to?
I'm about to make a move. What area you in/heading towards? I can wait you around there. what time you coming out?
On my way to Covert Garden, getting on a tube

What time should we come over?
I would say 7. Is that too late?
Annoyingly working with San Fran office, have to wait till 4pm to talk to them
Samir you in the office today?
I suprised that you ordered meatballs, they are illogical for you as you can't place them in your pockets
What was film we watched called again? No nothing or out of nothing?
Small nothing? Sounds like a band
Also got it :)
Sure, lets figure out where & what at the pub
give me 5 min to wrap things up
samir on dear
Here is a good animal collective track - peacebone 
Probably a good place to start - accessableish
Do you think I should mention DJ format night on Satursday on animal planet? Or do you think it upset Chris with lack of commitment to his art show thing?
As you know being subtle isn't my thing
Not yet will do tho.
Got ticket
What time you thinking about going?
Vegans and Hipsters don't come out till at 10/11ish I hear
I say
What time you thinking about going?
Oh dear boy
I was tempted to go Chris's show but I've been friend art shows before. Its abit awkward if u think their stuff is shit.
Then you have pretend that you like it
Ok cool, thanks for the pix & tip
Nah its all good
Are either busy with actual blippar work today? Would either one be free for Device wonder work to create birth certificate for a iPhone?
Although alternatively I could write this out
Awesome stuff
Yeah I am. Just water & OJ for me, no beer. Leave my place at 8.30 & get to venue or your place 9ish. Probably be early one for me tho 1ish, cant do another 6 in the morning.
Regarding beers, I see how I feel. I was just in hackney marshes & I came across some bisons (I'm quite fond of animals) it took me about 5 mins to figure out that they werent Bisons & actually big furry cows. So I'm defo still in goldfish bowl brain mode. But yeah meeting eariler sounds good.
Yeah I will have food before popping out. Will get yours by 8ish
Pick up what?
Just leaving my flat. Sorry I overslept needed a disco nap
Be there in 30
Need anyone want anything from shop? I cant produce Smack tho in no walter white
Whats your flat number? Just outside
Does the DJ look the same as the barman?
Not sure if I can do film club this Wednesday, might have do filming instead. Depends how it goes today.
On Thursday, I'm going to my old company'a
May be good for some networking too if you're looking for a new job.
As we are filming, are you wanting  to do your scene? Learned your lions
I just thought you said you were going to come to get some eggs. Its a games market, not a egg market or just come place on eggs on floor & go home. Anyway glad you're coming
I just thought you said you were going to come to get some eggs. Its a games market, not a egg market or just come place to put some eggs on floor & go home. Anyway glad you're coming
Walking there now
Go in if you want
Meet you in there
I was thinking a roast & board games later
Will go back to the market in abit
Does Jen fancy a roast dinner later?
There was no vegans there nor eggs
No correction 90% of population in Hackney are Vegan because its so progressive
Do they have eggs?
Vegan eggs?
Could be paper eggs?
With vegans
Nickname brainstorming has began: what about "Surfing Alligator Uzi Girl"?
Donkeys are better than Alligators
Cause Gifs always show the truth like a fortune teller.
As we are talking about the truth via the media of Gifs. Is that you as a baby lion?
Did you see any prehistorial donkeys there?
Cheddar man? Did smell of cheese or have lots of holes?
Yes that's the plan for me. Going to loading bar on sat night, will have quiet one tonight for culture day tomorrow
I doubt that. Just go to theirs at 12 and give them a morning wake up call
Save a good fart, that will do the trick for Rubage
Yup 12 o'clock
Be careful Chris & Samir, Ruby might be Rubyinator who wants to take out all other Ruby on Whales developers to ensure Rubynet takes over
That is why Ruby wants to visit to meet other robots
Im up for that, although abit hunover
He was probably either aciding or boning
Is that enough time? When do these exhibs close?
Pink Floyd you have book & its £24 per ticket & open up till 9pm tonight so we book for 8pm slot which is aviable
Yeah we could do that, see how it goes. Maybe go to Pink Floyd to book our timeslot & go Robots
So meeting at 2pm at south kennington station yeah?
Just fart on them
Oh you are awake?
On the train now, get there for 2.15 I reckon
You guys on your way?
Or still declaring vartiables?

Chop chop
Im here so message when you get here
Im at V&A now, they have tickets for Pink Floyd for 7.15pm timeslot
Thats the earliest slot we can go today & its open till 9.30pm tonight
They claim that there is only 40 tickets left & will be sold out soon
Its not like they need to sell it to me. It is a exhib for one of the world's bands & museums
Famious
Where are you? You nearby?
Im in V&A
You want to get Pink Floyd tickets or not?
Ok awesome, as you enter there is information & ticket booth I will meet you there in 5
Chris started a call.
Chris joined the call.
The call ended.
Why Harlow?
Shall we leave Friday night as the traffic wont be so bad?
What if we leave at 10pm & aim to get there for 1am? Or would be too tired to do that?
Ok so shall we go to Harlow on Friday night. Depending on how Chris is feeling we drive fri night or sat morning
But no drugs, just drink
Yeah indeedo
Annoyingly I have work late on Friday
So I may have to meet you later
Lol provably
Probably
£75 each, not much difference
She has a baby so no drugs for her
Waiting for Ruby & Samir to get their ass in gear
Beer
Vegans?
Beer or Vegans?
Sounds good!
I think we need a important discussion to determine if its "the dark lion" or "the dark ruby"?
Moot?
thanks for the translation
Im pretty easy order me whatever
Samir - Where you go?
Shall we leave?
Yeah I come to the pub. Sorry Lion but I cant be assed to go to central London but pretty tired from this week of blipparape. Im sure Pulp will be awesome in the pictures. What time you meeting at the pub?
Ok will meet you at the pub, probably get there for 8.30pm. Do you have to bring weapon? As I know football fans do like a fight
Ok sounds good. Shall I bring some pads? Could play some MP games? Everyone elseWe all going to Ruby's place then?
Shall bring anything else like some rubies?
Good call Do you like the Zelda games or played any of them?
I see :) Sorry Im feeling so wiped so going to stay in & have a pants day. Are guys going anything tomorrow?
NICOLCAS RUBY
Yeah i used to watch them live but these days I dont find them that exciting as its quite predictable
Ive been there a few times - good polish kebab. I think they have won some rewards or that be best kebab across the road
Kebabs are really good in Dalston/Stoke Newington. Its like kabab wars without the shoot outs or dead people.
25k followers - bloody hell
Where & when?
Meet you guys later, need to wash up. Just got back from the gym
Fancy doing a film night sometime this week? Tomorrow or Thursday perhaps? Happy for you guys to come to my place
Jen? Uzi Surfer croc girl?
She needs more of your Samir.
You can take that how you want. Your personality, Your Wisdom, Your 3rd arm. Im off from work this week so time isnt a problem.
Come over when you're free, Im just doing personal work stuff
Not sure if I have Street Fighter although Im sure it is on Netflix. I can a look
Yeah its on Netflix along with recent one good which Ryu's & Ken's orgin story like Batman Begins.
Its actually surpisely solid
It was youtube mini series which they edited together to make one film
Oh really :(
Just watching "Wallace & Gromit & the wererabbit" with my sisters kids. Is this what you're motherland is like?
So tomorrow or Thursday tomorrow?
Wallace & Gromit is very South West
Should do Thursday instead as that is "defo to happen" rather a "maybe". Unless you cant do Thursday?
Ok sounds good. Want to my place for 6ish? Or that too early?
Regarding W&G, you're right. Its based in Wigan.
Dont know 2bh, I just citymapper it. My post code is: E5 9GB
I normally walk everywhere
SF is on Netflix anyway unless you want in your collection forever but what I remember its pretty bad forgettable nonsense in a good way
Regarding dl movie files. Do you have memory stick to port/play at my place? Also you may to check that it will play on PS4
Doesnt PS4 only play MPEGs? Out of date with whole video file compactablity
Same here - Smart TV I forgot about that option
Bring it on USB stick & we figure it out
I cant be bothered with downloading stuff anymore 2bh. I used to love it in my 20's for the hunt of 1080 rip. Now it gives me headache. The signs of getting old
Yup
Wanna come over for 6.30?
We are certainly men that use many words
E5 9GB
Lion Street
yeah of course
E5 9GB
Actually that is the real postcode I was hoping you would remember I called it "Lion Street"
quicklest route for you is Liverpool Street, overground train to straight Clapton. Takes about 30 mins
The train goes to Chingford
Yup
Plenty here
Lion Kebab, Samir Curry, Ruby Carrots
Fascist
You both on the train yet?
Was going to get some beers but I wait you guys get here
I will come out and meet you both outside of the CO-OP
Either way I have monies to get some donkeys over!
Chris Jones added Nick Stone to the group.
I bought you flight ticket, you up for it? Barcelona
Your variables will be blown to another dimension. You see the world with new eyes, feel like you're been re-born
You dont want to in Spain mate, they fight bulls for fun
Only if you want create White Fists only club
Ruby mentioned about NYC trip last night when you planning to go? I was planning to go in April during Easter
The later the cheaper in theory
Can you afford to go then?
How long you thinking of going for?
I see! Very Sexy
I probably go for 8/9 days as I've never been before. Probably like 2/3 days doing the tourist thing, state of liberty, nintendo world, times square, etc
What? You will fuck your ass in NYC or you prefer fuck your ass than NYC trip?
Yup coming tonight
I don't think West has been broken in in our crazy ways
It was pretty lame last night
You can go for shorter amount of time as you're been before, I just managing your expectations.
You can get these cheap flights to NYC where you stop at Reykjavik
Last year I was going to Reykjavik for 3 days then NYC afterwards
As Reykjavik is small and very extensive. You can't get more socialist or exclusive than Iceland
Maybe its two different trips
I like to go for sure
Only in the summer
NYC in April/May - Iceland in July/Aug?
You have very international family
Maybe you should invent Ruby on wheels and get more followers
My guilt pleasure is "Black Sails" about the Pirates in the Caribbean
Which is similar to Vikings with style/tone
Taking history and making "hollywooding" it
Lots of fights and politics
holloywood it can call it "The last rubage"
and learn Ruby development
Talks about logic and refuses to speak anyone to understand his logic
who doesn't understand his logic I mean
like consuming food through his ass as the energy will his blood quicker
lol
Anyway back to trips, you more up for NYC or Iceland if you afford both?
I can't type it to explain. I will explain in person - old skool way
How does Iceland in July/Aug sound? How long you want to go?
Lunar month?
Will Leon turn into a werelion?
How long you planning to go to NYC for?
Yeah indeedo you have friends there!
I always wanted to live in NYC for a while
Never had the opportunity
can't they lend you on your potential of future revenue/value for world happiness? As you will invent Ruby on wheels
There won't be. You need to pitch it & make them believe you in
Being god isn't just about "magic"
But convincing people that you're a god
If I was a banker I certainly invest in a god
"Magic" is the keyword here as Magic is mystery & untangable, unmeasure source regarding if a god even exists or not
He is magic too. How could put a value on Jesus? How much money you think he makes?
Also he convinced the western world that he had powers turning water to wine
Interesting culture clash: Rubage and French UX Master
Rubage: You wanna come out for a beer?
UX Master: Nah I value of beautry of Art
never thought of you being medium
Talking of which you're in new mario game.
Being roded by Mario - what a honor
Hope you're become new mascot. Never know might have your own game or franchise "Lion boy"
Roll in $$$$
Still up for film club tonight?
Who downloaded Godzilla? If not, I have other ideas for films
Maybe Samir has it
You want to come along?
Cant you get some of followers to do it? You are a God afterall.
Steph cant as she is singing
do you think he could be your counterpart/side kick being a string god?
Nah London office cant with such high brow concepts
Cant cope
Im leaving now. Samir & West are meeting us in 30-45 at my place
Meet at Liverpool Street
You here?
Just outside - near Wasabi
This is hardcore where's wally.
Do you have the anime film "Legend of the overfiend"? Samir hasnt seen it & I think it would blow his mind
We talking about GITS & you were saying it was your 1st anime. Should get a ticket
Ruby you should get Ghost in the Shell ticket for tomorrow? Its a animated Blade Runner without the space jazz
Ruby in the Shell
Or Ghost in the Ruby
I like Chantal so its annoying that she is having her leaving drinks tomorrow
What was name of that pub we went to in west end over Xmas?
Before new years
Thanks sexy times
May be seeing Sam Strong's fav on Thursday - Simon Chang
Send it you all via email. Ive checked in, waiting for lot! Chop Chop
You lot I mean
I wish you could edit in FB like slack
Edit posts
Booked your flight to NYC yet?
Checked out your flights for Barcelona yet
ESA?
I've forward you flight email for NYC to your Blippar email
£350 round trip which is pretty good price
What do you mean Visa to go to america for a holiday?
Sorry I mean do you need a visa?
you booked your flight to NYC?
Yes for the flight or need a visa? Or  oth
Or both
Awesome! I have found a flat for £60 per night with 4 bedrooms. Send it over once Im back from cinmea
Yeah send details to sam now
Although located in Queens. Abit further out than Greenpoint
4 beds in 2 bedrooms, so one of those has sexy time. The other person will get to watch.
£80 per night tho, cheap as blind hooker
Thinking about it. We probably should wait to confirm Sam is coming or not
Could go whilst in NYC
Hear you're be up for this? They are playing in May in NYC. I wanted to use them in NYC :(
Oh Dear - You guys checked out your easyjet flights because I want to print out my tickets but need everyone to check out
Its on the email
For Barcelona, its next weekend, right? Sexy times
Lion dose of the day
Not another frenchy
Give me a second
You have pay for booking seats
I personally just think we have random seats
its only 2 hour flight anyway
None of you have checked in. Get on with it
I'm sure I did it back when
I pick seats its £43.99 extra so about 10.50 each
We need to check in again, not sure why! Bug
Figured it out, I have to check you in all
No worries its done
So what you want to do about seats?
I'm happy not paying 2bh, what about everybody else?
Yeah sorry just realized when once you check in, you can't change seats but we are sitting together anyway
So we are saving a tenner
You all need to print out your boarding passes
thats it. Mission complete
Talking about holidays, we need to sort accomuntion in NYC
Shall I book a bed in hostel then?
you're going to SF for some trip You're not sure if you can afford to come
Oh Ruby God
sorry I cant come tonight, need to be sharp for interview tomorrow. Do you have Soedu's number?
No worries I'm contacted James via PSN anyway. Yeah thanks :) Statistically I won't get it as MS have very high standards (no jokers), I just try my best & see what happens.
Another interview lined next week as well
Yeah I need to get new job as Blippar is just much too of mind fuck/hassle
That's werid. I didn't mean to paste that again.
With Blippar I had Satheesh who is now new Mathew had meeting yesterday with myself and all other App QA (because he insisted). Told us that testing process is rubbish and we all have start doing automation instead (I'm power phasing here). Wagner asked me afterwards "Do I still have a job as I don't know any automation?". Just puts me in really awkward situation & to questions which I don't know the answer to. I shouldn't be in this situation if this was handled better
People management & politics is so bad
These directors have these power trips and I clean up the mess
We still in process of implementing of Matthew wanted & now I have to change it to fit the power trip of Satheesh
To be honest, what he was saying that was right about more automation is needed. Just how he went about communicating that which is very damaging
Anyway moaning over
Wagner is probably looking for another job now
Senior management are just robots
So in summary, I got  Satheeshed instead of spensered
Anyway thanks for listening
Man you are racist, he is Indian mate
They all look the same Asians
to you
We could do film night tomorrow night
If you all want to meet up
Annoyingly the guy who was going interview me. His wife has done into labour so interview been delayed for another time TBC.
I hope you ride her like a horse
Shall we meet up at Farr's school of dancing (its a pub) at 7.30? Its near Dalston Junction
Of what? Horse riding? Being a Ruby god? In developer mode wriiting in Ruby?
Home in my pants
Shall we meet up at Farr's school of dancing (its a pub) at 7.30? Its near Dalston Junction
Meet earlier like 6.30 then?
I still have a few bits & bobs to finish up
So 7 would be better
Annoyingly I just realised that I have meeting with SF at 7pm, I wont get there till 8
:(
Yup I meet there at 8
I wont want a late one either
On my way now
Be there in 20
You going farr's school?
Yeah the same no euros

I havent started yet. Just left work, I hate working with San Fran
Fello movie geeks, any of you watched "after earth"? Is enjoyable easy to watch film or just crap?
Really? You are trolling me right?
Yup
this is serious matter I dont waste 90 mins of my life
Bummer
I like to think I have some worth or use
But I see your point
Its my list actually I probably end watching it till 4am
I love a good show
Just not right now
I love "Community" - writer/director is a comedy genius. Same guy as Rick & Morty
He is king of meta humour
Watching the interview instead
Just realised that I have a gig tomorrow night to see S U R V I V E - the stranger thing soundtrack guys, their albums are pretty good. So I can't do John Wick 2 tomorrow, could do Thursday. If not I will go over the weekend
Maybe it isn't vegan enough and they have to change the name to "John Vegan"
I had to delay to next week as it wouldn't go well having a man cold
:( It was logic thing to do as I've had no time to prepare/not the right mindset
So when & where we seeing John Wick 2?
Samir oh delay
Yup what time?
8.30 at VUE Islington, sound good?
or 5.35 or 11.25pm
Yup sound good - Samir oh come?
So you want to meet eariler before then/hand?
God - Do you want to come? Might inspire you for Ruby on wheels, hitmen meets Tron
Ruby
God
What's the plan tonight for John Wick 2? We all still up for it?
Man that sucks :( I was off on Tuesday, just got over it yesterday
Would Sunday be better?
Sorry mate
I'm getting old, I can't handle 3 days of drinking with no sleep
What works?
Out of all seriousness, he is PM mastermind so you probably learn alot from him. So you should try to pick his brain.
Fair enough, I cant keep up with all RippAR stuff these days. I'm easy either way, so Mike can only Thursday?
Could do Steph at Wednesday & Harris at Thursday?
Ruby on the fence
I see :( Tuesday?
How Rubysexual of you
No thanks, not my style
Ok sure I can bring a donkey
Yeah sounds good. Up for partying on this Friday?
Beatniks Boissonnet

Depends how much we party on Friday but I probably a culture/coffee day on Satursday
I'm planning to do something on Tuesday as it's my Cousin last day here from skippy land if you want to go to that
Still need to plan where we are going
Its near embankment
Could you visit after office hours 5.30?
OK
So anyone fancies going there on Tuesday?
Tyler Weekes Cristofaro Pantalons you in too?
Yeah to be honest, I need to spend time planning my trip to Thailand & my cousin leaves the UK on Wednesday, so Tuesday is her last night in the UK.
Yeah indeedo, Ruby Tuesday
Maybe film nigh next week
film night next week
What is Floating Voter Saga?
That is made up film
Just then I read your message as "They had to vote out of a plane (like mid air)"
Its hump day - middle of the week but we could change to Thursday as no one is able to attend anyway
on Wednesday
Oh Ruby god, you really are a god!
Yourself?
Noisy? No one is here
Sorry god I mistake your defined facts for humour
Going to book a table for the pub tomorrow
Beatniks Boissonnet - You will be bringing BF? Pantalons You coming?

Maybe I'm bored & easily excited
Afterall you're a god, you're got your T-shirt for everything. I just hope you're not one of those, tasted everything but has no taste types
That's deep
Vegans are taking over
Anyone making their way over to the pub?
What you talking about?
Yup

Why?
Double rape
Its funny how each thread created for partiluar purpose ends up with just photos of me forvsome reason
Maybe I'm big socialist hippie type but why not photos of other people? Surely Im not that entertaining.
Socialist wave
Maybe I should start a movement
VODS - Vegan Organisation for Donkey Socialist
Oh Ruby god
Too busy with your framework & becoming a god
Back on 25th so another 2 weeks, so please go ahead & watch porn or whatever you do together. Im up for a  escape room
What porno was that?
Why not? Porn is art
That isnt porn, that's pure 80's creative freedom. I call it "Art"
The plane just landed in London now
Its so cold here, I wanna go back
Indeedo, will back to UK time zone & use to weather
Im free :P
& Ruby god
I could get another friend along if you wanna do a escape room on sunday? Which one you thinking?
Yeah Im up for the escape room on Sunday I will tell my friend. What time we thinking?
Sounds good. So satursday at 6pm yeah?
Ok 4.20pm sounds good. My vote is the heist plan
Yes I need to send him your bank details & pay you too. I will do this today
Be interesting to see Ruby logic in action, will see declaring everything as a ruby
I thoughts lines (or lions) were your bread & butter
What time/where we meeting tomorrow for escape room?
On sunday, one step closer to a plan so where & when? In terms of defining these variables. "Where" is the location point of the entity of a person (in this case yourself) & "When" as the precise time to at the said location
Is that clear?
Precise Stephanie I like it :)
You guys up meeting before the escape room like 3pm? Be good to catch up with people
Do you know a place that does roasts after 4pm? Most pubs (in busy areas) will finish up roasts by then
What festivial?
MacBeth?
You're changing man, couldn't imagine you being in a Theatre
fitting as you being a lion & all. Do you get run around in the Wildeness?
Oh Ruby
Never knew that. Ruby is becoming more fitting as a nick name as I get you know more.
I used enjoy acting at skool, I didnt enjoy at college as my college filled pretentious twats
I guess going to BRIT school as apart of that
The bug?
Actor, Artist, Developer. You're well versed travelled cat arent you?
I knew you were a god
Used to like act like as old grumpy men
Escape rooms I've been at previously you're not allowed to use phones :(
Stuff your wrestling, just come instead
What pub is it?
Sorry I have to a chilled one tonight 2bh. Just starting a new job is killing me (tiring) plus I have my projects I'm building too (so like 2 jobs).
I don't think I can make it to New cross for 2pm, what's your address? I can get in your place for 3pm
8 hours? Thats the whole of the lord of the rings
Or the original star wars trilogy
will you be traveling by ruby on wheels?
Joke went over head
I think this is a discussion be in person or simply I put I would like see you try place wheels on ruby
What is your postcode?
You can walk between them its about 10-15 min walk
Getting on overground now, citymapper told me to get off at Brockley station. That near you?
Got to the house earlier than planned. Is this your house?
Im not stalker, promise
Let me know you're back to da house, I will hit a pub whislt i wait
Its posh around here for south London I was expectated to be shot at least a few times
RUBY
In the pub called "flower of kent" on lewesham way
Lewesham way is the name of the road
You love it
Shall we go somewhere else?
As there is no way to sit
The vegan pub
Thanks for the fun night & for hosting. We should do that again some time
Women & gay men were chasing me down the street. Sam Strong became my bodyguard defending them off
I told them about Rubage so they may be coming your way
Sounds fun, im up for that! Only request is that the turkey has to be vegan when it was alive.
boy - You know how to troll Stephanie good
Probably trying to figure out to tame you lions from trolling!
Sounds good
Yeah Castle Craahers is awesome. Basically modern version of Goldenaxe with RPG elements
Awesome, what time should we get to yours? Where you live again? I dont think I can just follow the yellow brick road
Im going to Dalston to get some bits & bobs then we can pop down. Not sure I just got up, need some breakfast. My prediction would be getting by Dalston by 1
Yeah the funny thing that came when I typed in "Party Lion" maybe thats how lions party
To be fair, happens to me I have a few & I fall to sleep
All those hobs & wheat in the beer
Probably scared for life
Ok being some fun stuff, I won't say what
Belong you Roar at people
Im leaving now so I be in Dalston in 30
Samir meets us on the train. Pop on like Indy
At Dalston Juction now, walking up the high street
Buy some more Santa hats if you can
Ruby San
Thank you very much for the food & having us. It was lovely & great fun. I was having super food coma at the end :)
Were you seeing donkeys or lioneses?
Stephanie - Whats your card details? How much we own you for the food?
Oh Ruby
You been declaring too many variables
Positive
Indeedo it does :)
Well shaped indeed
Nicolas Rubage
Funny my folks asking who was Nick Stone as they keep deeing just say my name
On FB on you keep writting Chris Jones
They have no context
You're right. I told them "you were godfather of the Ruby language & would be upset if you don't follow your logic of anti-UKIP polies" Then they started talking about African stealing all the diamonds
I afraid you're nisunderstood Ruby
Go where?
Is that club? I thought that rave was on NYD not NYE. Or is this a different one?
Yeah so this is for on NYD night rather NYE night
So would you be leaving 5am on 2nd of Jan rather being on 1st
Oh Ruby
Seems like you're having a nice trip
Wow classic :)
For NYE there seem to be two options from Blippar crew from what I gather:
1.) Fireworks in central london
2.) Houseparty at Seb's/Ruby (same area) as they next door to each other
On NYD night (the night after), Emmanuel & Ruby want to go to Rave. Got a good line up
I think that is it
"On the last episode of Blippar Mania"
Afterwards I haven't yet thought about. This is in central London, do something in town
Im just leaving the design museum. you up for meeting at 6pm at Noveiry exhib in Holborn?
fancy doing something in central after Exhib?
Any recommends for a pub in central london? I never go in central so any ideas?
Everyone can join
Could go to Covert Garden? Lol
I havent done the blippar thing yet I probably should as Blippar does pay me
Oh yes "Chandos" is nice. I havent been there in years
Ok wanna go there afterwards? 8ish sound good for everyone?
Samir oh dear
Found a table
Sorry I thought did. I must of forgot, anyway paid now :)
Samir oh dear the trolling master
On Saturday although iit is Maruel's house party unless we got to his house afterwards or before. What's your thoughts?
I go to his house afterwards
Trump will be there too
Look for the wave
You up there already? 30 mins of pepsi alien trailers
Or maybe a vegan trailer throw in
Hi guys, been speaking to Ruby god & he seems abit home sick. So I thought we should have "Welcome back" party for him when it gets back to UK & also for Sam Strong too. Would you all be up for that? 
A few things to decide on/figure out for such an event and I would like to get your thoughts on as I have some ideas already but not always the best. So here goes.. 
1.) The theme?  
I was thinking something ironically bad/not like him (opposite of his tastes) like Ruby Reggae party (no ruby no cry) or Gay Ruby party or Racist Ruby Party (maybe that is abit too far). 
2.) Where? Shagwell would be the obvious place but how would we do this without him knowing? Being a surprise is better right?
3.) When? When is he back in the Uk? I think he is back on 25th of April, maybe do it on the weekend - Sat 29th?
Same but I was thinking most of the work would be done on the Satursday for setting up the party, we get back on Thursday. Can you get him out of the house for the Saturday for a Ruby drug art day out? Whilst I get the party ready.
Obviously before hand need to decide on the theme & get the invites out
Invites as make people aware of the party via the usual methods
So you're happy to have the party at yours?
& can get him out of the house for the day?
Depends if I have anyone to help me to to setup & also what the theme is. I say roughly 3/4 hours. We need prep before hand, I do that on Thursday & Friday
Any ideas for Themes anyone?
OK but at least give some feedback on which theme you prefer/which you think would work (most fun for everyone)
Awesomes Matt. Good to have a wingman
Otherwise it will be Chris party not a Ruby & Sam welcome party
Could be a Mexican't Ruby party?
Pinata on wheels
It was
Trump voters & Mexicans
But it is very obvious, not that out there or entertaining but fitting as he was (at the time of the party) in america
Take that back it would be entertaining, just not orignal
Not sure if he is that cultured. Maybe I'm wrong. I personally can't tell the difference between french cheese & Japanese cheese, cheese is cheese if you ask me mate
lol indeed I tell the difference with Beer and pies tho :P
and potatoes
True and ask each person to come as different nationality. I will come as Japanese guy and tell people off with their lack of honor and spirtually
Could change the date?
Yeah they love abit of british culture
lol
So by the sounds of things, that Sat 29th April isn't ideal. What about the weekend afterwards? Saturday 6th of May? We can't left too long as it won't be welcome back party anymore
If you would, please take your out of the country discussions in another feed as this is party discussion, not I can't attend party discussion.
Yes I know but I see the patterns of the Matrix that this feed will quickly become about something which isn't the purpose of this thread.
Thanks for the offer, no worries. Its fun setting up parties but yeah you're right about  partying after a flight
Clearly Lions don't like parties. Maybe they afraid getting wet
Stephanie raised a good point maybe we should do it weekend after 7th of may as 29th April is bank holiday & probably be away.
Buy it & hide it in your room
Are you friends with Rubage other friends outside of RippAR
?
Going to create the event when I get home & I can invite most of Blippar crew but I don't know any of his other friends
Yeah I got him on my FB & that is it
Chris B I mean
Banyard - Could you help with the music list? The theme is Mexican't
Mexicans & thump voters so we need Mexican & Fuck yeah American music
Or you want to do that? You look Mexican anyway
Especially with your Mexican look
Lol
Walk around with pride
Donkeys are animals of the 21st century
I am indeed :) So will Ruby Mexican or Ruby Trump
Banyardmyself & Samir & maybe Lion if he recovers from his illness are going to see Free fire if you want to come?
Tonight?
Instead of free fire?
Just ask Lion boy to send you the tickets
Matt is leaving?
No mudwank or thamesside, anywhere not those fucking pubs
yup Anchor sounds good
I message later because I can't leave that early
Where we going? The Wanker Anchor
Sorry you rarely get to say those words together in actual context of the given conversation
One many phases I've been wanting to say in context
without offending anyone
too
Banyard - Do you want to see Free fire? We have spare ticket now
We got tickets in Hackney picturehouse
lcoated in Hackey Central area
Up the road from London Fields
We are coming to pub
So hold on, just need to wrap things up
Where are you Samir?
I hope you having a power wank
To have a power wank generally or a power wank at home?
Where are you oh dear?
What drugs you getting? Donkey vegan pills?
Is it vegan weed?
Blessed by donkey?
Can you paint? Myself & Steph came with the idea to make cardboard wall (which would like the border) & the wall would have holes in it to put your face like those things you have on beaches. One side your face be on Mexican & other side be fat banker American
Can you also paint for the purpose above?
Ok sure need to find a artist
Maybe ¦ boy
Need a artist as well
I'm going to start building the wall over the weekend, need to think about how to do this. Maybe Samir & Steph you can to come my place to help with creation/building process
of "The Wall"
Up for that?
Probably need to invite more people too, not sure how many blippar people are free or not
The plan is Samir on dear is leaving 5pm & bringing Rubage with him at Shadwell. We want to try get people there before 8pm when they return. So we have a few hours to prepare. would you be free to get Samir's for rough time help me setup? Any other voluteers?
Beatniks Boissonnet - Do you know fake looking cocaine? Using flour or whatever?
I mean do you know how to make fake cocaline? Like bricks of cocaline.
I asked Samir he doesnt know. He is getting all logical on me
Banyard I think its your destiny to come
She came up with idea so I assumed she was experienced in such field
A-Level fake drug making in France
So can you do it?
They wont be. We will convince them to stay with the concept of Rubycom conference
If I really have to,  I will play "you need have sex" card at the conference
"You will have sex" card sorry
Its a last resort unless we tell them
Its all under control, no worries. The worst case scenario is that we will delay for next week when they are both here but me & Samir will convince them that Rubycom is better than anything else.
This is what I do for living these days convince people for Bug A is better to fix than Bug B. So will be piece of cake.
Why?
Not enough bread?
Sorry Im not following. So you can come only till 8.30pm?
Samir is going take Nick & Sam out at 5, unless you can  do this eariler ?
Could do 4.30
I need to build the suport legs for the wall
Sort of in Clapton which is 25 mins on a Ubar
You know what, no worries I will be fine setting up myself
Just come to Party when you're ready
Come for 7ish, unless you want to help us setup
Yes you here?
Yes please
